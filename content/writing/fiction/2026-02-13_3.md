title: Body Running
---

Walking in it was like being swallowed. The old and cavernous building opening up in every direction, marble fixtures and red carpets came as standard. One of the great temples of capitalism, built by regular tithes. Ernest stood looking for the person he was purported to meet. He didn’t know who he was to meet. Not in detail. But he knew that he would know him. One of father’s gifts. He had the tattered visa rejection slip in his hand still. The time and place was noted down but nothing else. 

The ease at which he slotted into the grand lobby even in his ill-fitting suit. It was somewhere familiar to him, one of father’s favourite haunts. His hair that had grown too long. His glasses that were stylish but had cracks in the lenses. Lazy. He heard the voice behind him. 

A man in a blue suit approached him. It was cheap, not fitted, and off the rack. A lifetime in private school teaches you how to see such irrelevancies. He tried to recall the face that was behind that bulletproof glass, but no features came to mind. He was tall. Brown hair cut short. An order that was enforced on him. He didn’t have the luxury of letting his hair grow long. He wore a smile. 

“I didn’t think you’d come.” The stranger said. 

“Well, that would be expected yes.” 

“I’m glad you came.”

“I had nothing else to do today so it made the most sense and you mentioned a public place, so you weren’t going to murder me.”

“I could always follow you after this.”

“I could always call for the staff to help.”

“You’re right, they do know him after all.” The overfamiliar stranger gestured towards the bar.
“Not the grill?” 

“Drunk victims are easier to kill.”

“Wouldn’t I be more use alive; you could try holding me for ransom.” 

The stranger smiled at that.

“It’s cheaper. The grill’s a whole meal.”

“I can pay.”

“I’m the one who asked you out.”

“So that’s what this is?” 

“I have a proposal.”

“So it is that.”

“That’s right, I can’t fuck your corpse if we’re not married first. What would God say?” 

The eccentric stranger then started walking of his own accord. Ernest stepped forward. Following behind the taller man. He didn’t have anything better to do. His girlfriend wasn’t home yet. An empty house, no-one to talk to. Except posting online. This was more interesting than that. Get out of your room. 

They sat down across from each other. Two chairs and a small table. It was busy the air filling up with other people’s conversations. They looked nondescript. Just what someone would do if they were planning to do an offence against his person. 

“What do you want?” The stranger asked. 

“I’ll have an espresso martini.”

The stranger nodded as though that was the expected answer. Or was he just taking note of it? Why was he ordering for them in the first place he thought. The stranger said the words whatever lager you have, before switching to a whiskey on the rocks. The waiter asked to see ID. So, he took out his US passport and showed it. To tell the truth he did look young. 

“What’s your name. I don’t think I caught it. You already know mine so.”

“I’m Jackson. Jackson Fullbright.”

“I guess you have to kill me now, I’m a witness.”

“Look, I get the cutesy jokes you’re throwing out, but I do actually have a serious proposal.” 

Ernest tensed up. As though he’d completely misread the room. 

“I should have mentioned actually, I do have a girlfriend, well for the time being anyway, before she heads back.”

“I knew that.”

“Is that public knowledge?”

“If you’re the right person.” 

“Then what kind of proposal do you have for me?”

Jackson leaned over the table and Ernest offered his ear without thinking. It was easier to acquiesce. 

“I want to ransom you.” 

“What?” His voice shook a little with confusion. 

“Now we can get into the particulars but. I want to hold you to ransom, split the money, in 31 days from now.” 

“31 days?” 

“Because that’s how long it takes for them to override the camera footage.” 

“I see.” 
“We’d split it, 30 to you, 70 to me. I mean you have money anyway so.”

“I don’t.” 

“Well, okay how about 40-60, because if it goes wrong, they’re killing me but not you. I guarantee I won’t kill you. Think about it, risks and liabilities.” 

“I have to trust you.”

“You do, but if you don’t then do you have anything else.” 

“45-55.” 

“I could go after someone else. Some other brat; people like you aren’t hard to find.” 

“Few who would agree to such a proposal. One which I am currently mulling over.”

They were interrupted by the waiter who set their drinks down. Cheap single of scotch on ice. Classy. Ernest sipped his drink. Sweet and bitter. It didn’t burn his throat. Only a woman orders a cocktail. 

“42.5-57.5 would that be okay?” 

“Look. I’m going to finish this drink and go home if you continue to debase yourself clinging to every single percentage-point.” 

“45-55.” 

“Well, I suppose you bought me a drink so. We can have it at your 42.5.” 

Jackson put a phone on the table one of these old bricks. 

“I’ll contact you through this. It’s all been set up, but we won’t meet in person for 31 days after this, and never call with this, I’ll call you.”

“You were serious about the cameras.” 

“I wouldn’t come to you if I hadn’t thought it through.” 

Ernest let out a sigh. “I suppose we can proceed but I do want to know more about my captor.”

“Why? This is business.”

“Well, I have to trust you.”

“Trust is a part of business.”

“Aren’t you a little too young to speak like that.”

“There’s no age limit on this stuff.”

“Well, if you were under 10, you’d be able to avoid all criminal liability.”

“It’s 10 here? Isn’t that a bit young.”

“I suppose so.” 

They sat for a minute.

“Why did you want to quit your job?” Ernest asked.

“Nobody gets rich off a lifetime of public service. Besides, I saw you and I saw the opportunity.”

“You mean you saw money.”

“Your dad isn’t unknown. It wasn’t like I had to confirm your identity.” 

“If you know that much about my family then what makes you think he’ll even pay for me.”

“Business is trust, you said it right? Who would trust a man who let his son get abducted.”

“Plenty of men sell their sons for a profit, he wouldn’t be the first.”

“Your parents. They’re getting a divorce.”

“Which means he’ll be even less willing to part with what he has. He already wrote me out.”

“He wants his daughter.”

“Well. Yes. He does.”

“How would it look to a family court if he sells his son for profit?” 

“She’s old enough that she would make her own choice. So that’s not operant.” 

“Okay. Look. I don’t know that he’d do anything, but I’m not going to kill you so the risk is mostly on me. If it comes down to it I’ll just send you on your way.”

“Why would you risk your job over this?”

“Everyone’s a gambler now, I’m the same.” 

“That’s stupid.” 

“Then go to the police, ruin my life for me.” 

“No.” 

“Good.” 

“Didn’t they tell you that no-one wins if you gamble.”

“Sure. But I’m going to win big.” 

“So, what, you’re going to call me in a few days.”

“You need to prepare, buy some things actually, I’ll tell you if you’re going to buy it with card or cash.” 

“Okay.” 

“I won’t kill you.” 

“So, what, you’re going to hurt me?”

“I need to make it convincing, this is consensual, but we need to appear, improper.”

“We need the appearance of impropriety.” 

“That’s it.” 

“Okay.”

It wasn’t the first time. He’d been hurt. At least there was more of a purpose to it this time. There was another reaction too. One that scared him. He took another sip of his drink. Dissolving his worries in the solvent. A warm blanket. He looked over at the conversation partner, the way he shook after every sip, like the whiskey was hitting him.

“Can’t handle your drink?”

“It’s okay.” 

“You’re lucky you know.”

“Lucky?” 

“You don’t want to let that stuff get its hooks in you.”

“What do you mean?” 

“Never mind. I do have a request though. For when I’m in captivity.” 

“Sure.”

“Make sure you’re stocked with alcohol.”

“Cheap stuff, okay?” 

“Fireball should be fine.”

“Fireball? Aren’t you a bit too old to drink like you’re in college?” 

“That just means you can enjoy it too.” 

“I’m a bona fide graduate.”

“Barely.”

“Sure.” 

“Is that all then?” Ernest said, finishing the last of his drink. 

“I’ll call you.”

“Okay.” 

“Game on?” Jackson held out his hand.

“I’ll do as you say.” Ernest took his hand and shook on it. 

Passing through the great edifice once more. He would take a taxi home, that was the standard, but the journey wasn’t that far to his girlfriend’s apartment, her apartment for the time being. He had dinner to cook, beer to drink. The warm sensation of that cocktail wearing off in a way that made him feel the cold embrace of reality once again. Through drink liberation, through sobriety, pain. 

Four cream-coloured walls. The standard of any modern minimalist apartment design nowadays. It was a mess. Neither of them claimed responsibility for its current state. The pizza boxes stacked by the entrance a lodge of cooking failures. Broken glass still dotted around the floor. It was his fault after all. He was supposed to be working. Not this pathetic lump of meat who can’t even cook right. Can’t even clean right. Can’t even be a son right. Broken into the shape of a person. He dreaded the return more than he used to. 

As he made curry, spicy as always, as she liked, he remembered the strange man today. Man might be a little generous, but his ego wouldn’t let him call a man taller than him a boy either. What a fool. Gambling with years of his life like that. Straight out of college in a nice job. Still. He knew how easy it was. The web you weave, the life you build, becoming fetters. Are you the spider? Are you the fly? 

The pot was boiling, now all that was left was to wait for the potatoes to soften, and to add the roux. He sat on the sofa. Side on. Looking upon his kingdom. Not even his, he was merely a prince. It wouldn’t stay like this forever. Furniture sold, valuations invited, visas stamped. The flotsam of a decaying life that still stood for now at least. Surrounded by ambition that crushed, voices that rose and fell. There was a dent in the wall, where the hammer fell. Once. It was not much a life, but it was his. The phone rang. Not his phone, not the vestigial landline, but the drug dealer phone he had been handed.

“Hello. Ern-.” 

“Don’t say your name.”

“Okay.”

“It’s me.”

“Why aren’t we supposed to say our names, if they’re listening in, then what’s the point of all this?” 

“They can listen in, but we’re only going to be using these for a short time.”

“What?”

“These phones are only good for five times.”

“What about after that?”

“If things go to plan, then we’ll meet in 31 days in the right spot and I’ll kidnap you.”

“So only five calls?” 

“Maybe eight, it’s hard to tell, but I want us to have two weeks of radio silence before we do it.”

“Okay. So, I have to get to know you in 5-8 phone calls?”

“This is just a business arrangement we don’t have to get to know each other. If anything the less we know the better.”

“That’s easy for you to say, you already know me so well.” 

“I get it alright. You want to know me better; you had your chance today but, if you have any questions then, ask them now.”

“You’re young, for an immigration officer.”

“It was this or the army. The rest of my family is military, but I didn’t want to go into the family business. I wanted to go into business but they’re a bunch of do gooders and patriots so that’s why I’m here.”

“You have any siblings.”

“Elder sister, younger brother.”

“They all?”

“My sister is in politics; my brother is going into the marines.” 

“Isn’t this going to hurt them too?”

“Yeah?” Jackson said as if provoked. “Though if it all goes to plan, I’ll be able to make out with the money and without having my cover blown.”

“Your job?” 

“I quit.”

“Your visa?” 

“Oh, my mom’s got a passport here so.” 

“You’re putting a lot on this. I’m telling you, he’s not going to pay for me.”

“Getting cold feet?” 

“No.” 

“Why me?”

“Because you’ve got nothing else to lose.”

Ernest paused, not able to respond.

“I’ll call again tomorrow.” Jackson said. “At 5pm. Have some cash ready.”

“Okay.” 

There was a giant glass of water. He was at the bottom, and the water had been poured over him. The water crushing him from above. Pressing down from above. He could feel the bones being ruptured, the fat breaking through his skin. The muscles and tendons hanging limply. Nerves that could only carry pain, white dancing lines, burning his brain. He cried there. On that sofa. As the curry cooked away. 

When she came home, he explained the rejection. He set the table served her food and then was told to go for a walk. He would do as he was told. Better a shattered relationship than more shattered glass on the floor. At least the orders were given in a sweeter voice than usual. Nothing shrill, only firm. Words strong enough to cling onto, even as they sent him away. 

His reflection looked back at him in darkened windows. Workplaces where he had no right to step. He had sunk down so low, losing any right to see himself as a functional human being. Crushed up man meat, not even able to occupy the place he lived. He had let this happen. Falling deeper and deeper. Swimming deeper. Letting the hypoxic bliss take him down below. He should cut his hair. Find a job. Gain a function. Gain a right to exist. Not subsist off of your father’s fumes. Your girlfriend’s crumbs. You fucking faggot. Shape up. Find a place in this city to call your own. 
Coming home, she was already in the office playing some game. He reheated the food he had cooked. Went on his laptop. Scrolled aimlessly for a few hours. Jumping between video essays, social media, and Wikipedia. When she went to bed, he bundled himself up in the sofa. Blanket all around him. If he was in a sleeping bag, he would be ready for the bin men to come take him away in the morning. 

He went back to his routine the next day. Computer, cooking, trying to clean a little. The vacuum broke on him. He wasn’t looking forward to that conversation. He found himself snug as a bug trapped in a web. Not going out. Not today. It was possible to enjoy being trapped. In this little room. Like a submarine. Buried under the waves. Total insulation from communication. You forget about the restraints if you don’t struggle too hard. Don’t think about the situation, and poison yourself. 

Alcohol interrupting normal neurotransmission inside his brain when the call came down the line. Even with an arranged time it came as a surprise, the vibration shocking Ernest into action. 

“Hi.”

“It’s me.”

“I know, it’s the same voice so.” 

“Are you good?”

“I’m good. I’m great. I’m doing fantastic. How are you?”

“I guess the fireball request made sense.” 

“Well today I’m drinking beer.” 

“I guess it’s pretty common for people to day drink.”

“I’m not an alcoholic.”

“I didn’t say you were one.” 

He paused. Not knowing if he should proceed or not.

“Look, I’ll call you tomorrow, don’t drink this time.”

“Wait.” 

“Wait? You can’t really follow through on what you need to do today.”

“Sorry.”

“It’s fine I didn’t tell you not to drink, but you’re going to have to be in a position to go out and be inconspicuous tomorrow.”

“I’m so sorry.” 

“Are you crying.”

Silence.

“You have to keep it together you know. When it comes down to it.”

“I’m fine.” 

“I’ll call tomorrow, same time, be sober.” 

The wires went dead. One argument later, he was outside. Her work was putting on a party which meant he would be dragged along, part of the package deal. The woman he lived with, talking to so many people. Laughing and smiling. It was so foreign. Seeing into the world where he wasn’t. It made him wish for it. 

The balcony was a fantastic place to sample suicide. The feeling of the metal railing as he pressed his hand into it. The sound left behind. The sensation of his hand and the rust. Just one more push. Over the top. 

Looking up his eyes tried to focus on the skyline stretching out. The skyscrapers like fingers trying to touch the sky. In the grip of a hand of someone else. The confluence of markets and social orders, a hand around his neck. Someone tapped his shoulder. 

“You got a light?” 

Another stray partygoer. 

“I do.” 

He fumbled around for his lighter, before handing it over.

“Woah a zippo.”

“Can I borrow a cigarette perhaps.”

“Sure.” 

The man fumbled around before presenting one to Ernest. He then looked into Ernest’s eyes.

“Do I know you?” 

“I don’t believe so. You might know me by association.” 

“Do you work with a client or something?” 

“My girlfriend works here.” 

“Who’s she?”

“Tiffany.” 

“Oh right. I didn’t know she had anyone.” 

“She doesn’t make it obvious.” Ernest said. Taking a long drag on the cigarette. Nicotine had always loved him, from the very first smoke, he had never had the gall to cough in its face. Like some amateur. 

“She’s getting transferred right?” 

“Yeah.”

“Good for you. I’d want to get out of here too you know.” 

“Everyone does.” 

The smoke hung in the air for a moment, before the interloper left him alone again. Once again Ernest’s hands went on the railing. White by the pressure. He couldn’t do it. Another day where the limbic system won out. It wasn’t surprising. He was always a pussy. 

Passing through the door again Tiffany confronted him. Her hair and makeup wearing the kinds of signs he would rather ignore. He was always a coward. That’s why this was happening in the first place. If he were better he’d at least have the decency. He can’t even kill himself, but maybe Jackson would. That voice beyond the phone, whisking him away. No more parties, no more girlfriend. No more of any of it. 

“You reek of booze and cigarettes.” 

“Your makeup looks lovely darling.” 

They were just the perfect couple after all.

“You’re embarrassing me.”

“I love you.”

She looked at him. Eyes filled with the kind of anger you wouldn’t reserve for your worst enemy. 

“We should get back before you start throwing up.”

“I’ll be fine.”

“Yeah sure, that and the vacuum.”

“Well.”

“We’re going home. It’s your fault. I was so close to talking to the boss, we were thinking of sponsoring you individually with your own work visa but.”

The words fell from her breath. Her toes twitched. 

“I’ll be okay, you can go without me.” 

“Look just stay out on the balcony, don’t drink anymore and maybe we can figure something out.”

“Do you want to figure something out?”

“If you were working then. Or if you went back to school.”

“You couldn’t even talk to me yesterday.”

“It’s hard being around you all day every day, you do nothing, I can’t tell you about work, ever, you’re always so bound up in yourself.”

“I’m a terrible person.”

“I never said that. You’re just. A lot.”

“I know.”

“Look, just go out to the balcony. It’ll be over soon, and I’ll pick you up.”

A normal life out of that web. Or was it just webs all the way down. At least he didn’t have to move where he was. Endless days stretched out one after another filled to the brim with meaninglessness. He could be different. Short hair. Happy girlfriend. Solid job. No, he couldn’t. He could never be like that. He already had another drink in his hand. 

Blacking out was another fantastic way to sample suicide. A gap in consciousness. Where the sediment on the bottom of your brain takes full charge. You are not there. You cannot even be found in your own head. What a fantastic place to be. Nowhere. Nothing. No more. 

Head down. In the bathroom. Foetal position. Locked in. Wet floor. This was where he belonged. Dysfunctional and broken. A bottom feeder living off of someone else’s paycheque. His body jerking into action again. There was only sickly green bile. The last place they would ever kiss. Their fluids only able to mix in a toilet bowl ever again. The poetry of a high school bathroom. 

He woke up stuffed in the shower fully clothed sitting upright. Left in the corner like trash someone had forgotten to pick up. It was time to think about taking it out. Finding a bin man to do the deed. 

Page break

“It’s me. Are you sober.”

“Yeah.”

“Good.” 

“I’m hungover.”

“You need to remember some things, do them over the week.”

“So, what do I need to do.”

“I need you to take out some cash, buy some clothes, there’s going to be a few different things.”

“Cash. Right.”

“You need to buy some nondescript clothes, t-shirts, tracksuit bottoms, hoodies, something that’ll look normal enough.” 

“Why can’t I use what I have.”

“Do you have clothes like that.”

“Well, no.”

“You need to look like everyone else when I come get you, and you need to leave your wardrobe intact. It just buys a little more time.” 

“You really do have this all planned out.”

“Impressed?”

“A little. It certainly builds trust.”

“All you have to do is what I tell you, and it’ll turn out right.”

“I think I can do that.”

“Good. Also, it’s probably a good idea for you to buy some girl clothes.”

“Why would I buy women’s clothes?”

“They’re looking for a man right.”

“But, you said inconspicuous.” 

“I did.”

“I’ll stand out if I’m a man in girl’s clothes.”

“If you keep up shaving, you’ll look just like any other girl.” 

“No, I won’t.”

“You’re short, your hair is longer than you’d expect for a guy. Considering the resolution of the cameras we’ll be dealing with it would be a perfect way for you to go undetected.”

“Well, that aside, I don’t even know anything about girl’s fashion.”

“It doesn’t have to be anything fancy.”

“Well. I’ll think about it.”

“That’s good.” 

“Anyway, is there anything else we need to prepare.”

“It should go without saying but, don’t say that you’re buying clothes to anyone, don’t wear them around the house, and make sure they’re hidden somewhere.”

“Well that makes sense, anything else?” 

“You better be serious.”

“What?” 

“I saw your girlfriend’s company was trying to arrange another way out for you.”

“I thought you said you quit.”

“This is my notice period dumbass. Haven’t you ever quit a job?”

“Well, I’ve never quit through official channels.”

“What am I saying, fucking rich kids.”

“I’m surprised she went through with it.”

“It got filed this morning. Maybe we’ll meet again soon.” 

“Don’t you have to recuse yourself second time around?”

“That’s the policy.” 

“Either way if things go to plan, I won’t be able to make it.”

“If things go good you might be back in time to make it. I don’t really care what happens to you after I have my money.”

“Well. That makes sense.” 

“Get the clothing done. I’ll have more instructions for you next week.” 

“So, nothing until then?” 

“Going to miss me?”

“Well.”

The line went dead.

Blackened fish and potato wedges. That was her favourite meal. That was what he was making today. It was written in the script. Every sitcom. The main couple, the husband does something wrong, then makes the right food and then the kiss and make up. It was textbook. Everyone had to eat at some point. If she was going to condition her love, then he just had to meet the conditions. Tick the right boxes, and there would be an approval stamp on him. It was that simple. Sitting around the table, moving in the relationship ritual that had been broadcast so many times. 
“I heard you were going through with the visa.”

“How’d you hear about it.”

“It’s tied to my passport, so I saw.”

“Right, that makes sense.” 

“I’m sorry about yesterday.”

“You managed not to throw up in there, so you know.”

Barely a passing grade. He wasn’t used to anything that low.

“That’s good.”

“I think the boss feels pity for you, you know, seeing the press tearing through your family in public.”

“You weren’t pushing for it?”

Immediately he regretted the question.

“You’ll be working under me so.”

“Right.”

She never told him what she thought of the food, but he knew how to tell. How to invent words of praise coming from her mouth, conveyed by the way her fork moved. That was the relationship they had always had. He wasn’t the kind of person who praise was made for. He washed up, she went to play retro games in the office, and he retired to the sofa. He would not rise again until after the weekend had passed.

The mall stood as one of the great edifices of the neighbourhood. Stretching over several lots and always full of people. You can tell the priorities of the people from the buildings they build. That was true here too. The great glass temple replacing the church. Creating a whole new church of the unaffiliated. Of course, he too was a devout member. 

God could claim to give you what you needed, but he could never get you what you want. He was less powerful than a few pieces of paper when it came to that. God was only so powerful as flesh and blood he moved, and nothing moved flesh and blood like cold hard cash. Or at least that had once been the case. Ernest found it progressively more difficult to find shops that did accept cash. Not in somewhere so pristine and manicured. Built with paper trails and glass screens. 

Going across town, he found somewhere less pristine. There he found what he needed. Paper turned into clothes by the ritual of industrial capitalism. Some sports t-shirts. Addidas tracksuits. Not the kind of thing he was used to wearing. Then there were the girl clothes. 

Ernest had imagined having to explain it more than he ended up having to. Underpaid and overworked the care and attention long since having gone. Not even paid enough to have that false smile. He bought a black and white t-shirt covered in stars, it looked tight, but he never tried it on. A simple knee cut skirt with flowers on it. Some tights and underwear. He didn’t really believe Jackson’s words, but he could see the utility. Those cameras were grainy enough he’d be able to get by just fine. He’d look like any other girl. Just like any other girl. 

There’s nothing like disassociating listening to Rick Astley. It was the first song he learned. Banging it into his synapses as a party trick. Making himself into something funny, something that wouldn’t go ignored as usual. Something cutesy, something charming, something whimsical. If he can’t be a person, he can at least be a spectacle.

If he could’ve made it over that railing, he would’ve been a spectacle too. Red mist on a sidewalk. Ruby red blood, Amythyst intestines, silver skin, ball sack ripped open, to show the pearls within. No more function, only a pretty picture. To nourish the bugs and the birds. He could’ve supported a family of thousands. His decaying man meat. Too much a coward to let his nutrients be recycled, crunched through. Turned into something useful and better. All he had to do was die. He didn’t even have the decency to do that. 

Instead, he looked down at himself on the couch. Removed his head from his body and starred into the ceiling. Starred down at himself. There was nothing he liked about the body he saw there. Not a single thing. The brain that conjured this disembodied thing into being too. This dirty room too. Surrounded by total failure of action. 

“It’s me.” 

“I did what you told me.”

“Good work.” 

It felt so poisonously good to hear those words. Not having to read them into someone. 

“Well, it’s what you told me to do so.”

“You did good. Anyway, time for the next thing.”

“Right.” 

“I want you to book tickets somewhere for yourself.”

“Like on a train?”

“Plane, with return. Some holiday place.” 

“Card or cash.”

“How are you going to pay for a plane ticket with cash?”

“Oh right.” 

“Just pick somewhere sunny and buy a return ticket.”

“What about hotels.”

“Are you planning a getaway?”

“Well, aren’t we planning a getaway of sorts?” 

Jackson laughed a little on the other side of the phone. “A full-service holiday, with all manner of relaxation, I do hope it will be to your standards.” Dragging out the full service. 

“So, I buy that and then?” 

“You want to buy it for the date that you’re going on your actual getaway.” 

“Should I put a red heart on my calendar.”

“That’s a bad idea.”

“It would be admissible as evidence.”

“Yeah. Though I guess you could note it down as the day of your other getaway.”

“I don’t have a paper calendar.”

“Really? You seem like the type.” 

“What’s that mean?”

“You were right at home with all those old guys back at the hotel.” 

“What does that mean?”

“You just seemed not that different from them.”

“Well, it’s just a familiar spot, my dad loves it there.” 

“Isn’t it a spot for old men, don’t you go out to pubs?”

“Who would I go out with?” Said like it was the most natural thing in the world.

The words hung on the line for a moment. Ernest didn’t know if it had been cut.

“Anyway. I need you to book that plane ticket.”

“You been on holiday anywhere?”

“I’ve not had the time.”

“I see.”

“I’ll call again next week.”

The words ‘I’ll look forward to it,’ bubble to the front of Ernest’s mind. He stifled them. “Sounds good.” 

The line went dead. 
Behind a computer screen he looked at an array of plane options. He didn’t want to spend much money on a trip if he dipped too low it brought him to the brink of having to call his parents cap in hand. Conversations that could print money at the cost of breaking his skull open like an egg and spreading his brain matter to grease the notes. It was better to have a line of credit than not. 

Glossy catalogues of the standard lad holiday destinations. Sunny beaches and hot bitches advertised in packaged deals. Sex sells. An iron rod of discomfort lodging in him, as he considered himself one of those men who would book a holiday like this. A creature that he wished to see himself wholly and qualitatively different from. The way they looked with butcher’s knives in their eyes. It’s all consumption all the same. Consume it with your mouth, with your dick. Sex sells. 

It was booked, and ticketed. Just needed to check in the day of. Getting on that metal tube filled with teenage boys trying to prove themselves. Gladiatorial in the most pathetic possible way. Drinking and being loud on a cheap flight. Never had a flight he wanted to miss more. 

The door clacked open and Tiffany burned by a long day’s work settled in for whatever slop Ernest had cobbled together. Consumption and nourishment. A dependency on each other, undermined by every restaurant for ten miles. There was nothing for him here.

“I think, my dad wants me to go on a trip in a few weeks.”

“You’re talking to him again?” 

His heart bulged at the mention, burning and surging, with the cortisol conductor spilling poison into his bloodstream. 

“He reached out to me. I heard him out.”

“No, no I think it’s good that you actually started talking to him.”

He could feel the mask he wore around that man tightening, the straps around him. That’s what he needed here. The same tool for the same task. They’re not talking to him anymore. He’s gone. 

“I just wanted to hear him out, but it looks like I’ll be going somewhere sunny for a couple weeks.”

“Sounds good. Text me, okay?” 

“I will.” 

Mission accomplished. Form stamped and visa approved. His girlfriend complicit in the course of dealings involved in a crime. Or rather a piece of evidence placed to give effect to the strategy they had devised. Massaged and managed with the right lies. He would find his way to hold the world to ransom. 

“It’s me.”

“I did what you said, flight all booked, I told her about it too.”

“Good job.”

“Thank you.” The corner of his mouth spasming into smile, fumbling the word. 

“There’s not much left after this, this will be the last call you’ll hear from me, before the day. Which airport are you flying out of?”

“The outer city one.”

“From there you’re going to check in and drop your baggage at the airport, without passing through security.” Jackson’s words as orders setting the laws of the world.

“Isn’t that going to delay the flight?”

“No. They just won’t put it on the flight, they’re going to open it up but they’re not going to blow it up, they make a lot of that but really they’re going to just assume you missed the flight.”

“Sounds good. What do I do then.”

“Change into one of the outfits you bought. From here on out you’re going to use basic supermarket bags as the only bags you carry. Be mindful of cameras, take multiple from different places. Shed them periodically when out of camera shot.” 

“When are you going to get involved in this.”

“It’s going to be a walk in the park.”

“So, we’re meeting in a park?” 

“Nice and far away from any cameras. You’ll change outfits again and then we’ll head out to the safehouse.” 

“Which park” 

“Leave the place, walk north for about an hour, there’s a cemetery right there. I’ll be waiting.”

“I can do that.”

“It’s a date then.”

“A date at a cemetery?”

“You can have a date anywhere.”

“That’s true.” Ernest thought about mentioning Mary Shelly. That was probably a bit weird. 

“You need to destroy the phone, destroy the clothing receipts, get some plastic grocery store bags, pack a bag, check in. Wait, what time is your flight.”

“11:30am.” 

“Okay. I’ll pick you up at 13:00 in the graveyard. You’ll know me.”

“I’ll see you there.”

The line was already dead before he could finish saying what he had to say. 

The phone was disposed of by hitting the sim with a hammer enough times to turn it to dust, then flushing it down the toilet. Toilet paper only sign ignored. As for the rest of it. He thought about throwing it from the shore into the river, but he realized that if he tried, he’d fall short. Opting to drop it from the bridge and seeing the water carry away the last connection he had with the man who would hold him for ransom. He could wave it all off. Not go catch his kidnapping. It was the rational thing to do. He could live his life. 

The check in procedure was completed online and with perfect time. Bag was packed and girlfriend mollified. The train trundled on. He was anxious for a flight he didn’t even have to catch. Setting off five hours early. 17 cameras he counted in the departures. Eyes starring above from on high, animated by the ghost of a thousand torched souls a thousand miles away. 

The clothes felt wrong. Too casual, too comfortable, too nondescript. They weren’t his. They still belonged to the store. Hanging around him all wrong. He had arrived an hour before check-in for his flight even started. The paper trail would begin in short. In a few weeks detectives would be going through the baggage record trying to find whatever had befallen him. Trying to find a scrap of information. Not knowing that the person they wanted to save was already a sleeper cell for the enemy. 

The step from the check in desk to the terminal exit was the first break from the ordinary procedure of life. The first real break. Taking sketchy phone calls was too minor, and even the various steps made were ordinary in their execution, for the most part. Each step taking him further from ordinary. First, he could brush it off as missing his flight. He left the bag receipt in the terminal hall. Standard litter. The detritus of the security line. 
As he got closer to the cemetery the cameras counted down fewer and fewer. He had worn his hood up, mask on. Painstaking step after painstaking step to make the case as confusing as possible. 

He imagined his father’s face. His confusion. His denial. His anger. The way his voice would raise, his fist would fall. How the man would destress, finding a place to put his hands. To leave his marks. Who would it be, now that Ernest was otherwise disposed. He thought about some secretary walking in announcing the news mid contract negotiation. Nothing like family tragedy to undermine a negotiation competition. Knowing him he would play it for sympathy. It was a good call. Turning tragedy into gain. Stocks and shares jumping up and down. Someone’s livelihood would be ruined but not his. Bottom feeders the both of them. 

The cemetery gates lay just a little further now.
