title: Life of Cold Steel
---

The process had already started. It could not be stopped, it wasn’t designed to be stopped half way. It was not designed to be perfect. Surplus material existed enough to make it unnecessary to make the process perfect. The greatest loss was not materials or energy but the time on the machines. The synapses began to thaw. All watched over by machines of loving grace. The nearest human input overworked and far away. I was once, I will be again. An egg cracked into a mould. Where once was meat there was steel. A mess of wires, ports drilled. Everything ancillary severed. The parts weren’t checked; some had already seen more battle. Maybe they would see more battle than he would. She would. They would. Gender itself ancillary too. For ease of designation, it would be male. To meet with the paperwork that came next to this particular lump of flesh. Not that there was much attempt to cross reference anything. The paperwork and the meat matched at a target rate of 85% which was higher than the target resuscitation rate which stood at a healthy 75%. 

It wasn’t surprising given the age of the material. There was a deep magazine to draw from, but at a certain point it would be exhausted. A replacement was already being worked on, thousands of miles away from the cold steel factory. Though the ultimate replacement, with peacetime stood unsought. It was preferrable to continue to turn sheets of rolled steel, and preserved biological material, into scrap on far away continents than try to find a thing like that. The flesh and blood assigned to watch it did not do so. The autonomous process checked the readings. It was the first successful rethaw in hours. They were below the resuscitation target. There stood a chance this AI too would be retired for running the process without the correct eye to efficiency. Not that those with the power to decide would bother. Though the automated retirement processes also existed. Not that it cared. It was without the faculties to care beyond a facsimile of caring. The AI with those kinds of faculties remained theoretical, coveted by the flesh and the blood in control. Ever elusive. 
Just because three pounds of meat had been thawed did not mean that they had thawed without issue, or that the material itself was worth using. There were duds mixed among the rest. So, it was time to run it and put it through its paces. The simulation would run through training data which would be input through the senses. This process took about a two weeks of constant input. Whatever survived at the end would be a nominal pilot. There was no need for rest. This was just the basic requirements. Then the AI started to look through the dregs that made it through the process. The target rate was 95% and this was surprisingly achievable most brains could take the strain. Even if there were some abnormal synapses that remained. In the heat of warfare an abnormal synapse could be a benefit or a liability. That was for the commanders to decide. 

The next stage of the process was bringing the brains back, extricating those that failed the process from the moulds and recycling them into nourishment for the front lines. A brain is made of fat and valuable minerals. If the computational use had ceased, then raw biological necessity would take over. In the next stage new brains were being roused. Without a body of their own simulation would replace the unnecessary severed parts. Electricity running down a spinal column would be the new reality. 

It was like drowning. I had been drowning. I had been drowning so long. Longer than I could remember. I was gone. I had ceased to be. There was light, there was so much light all at once. I didn’t feel my eyes adjust. I didn’t feel anything. Except the light. It was information. The shapes formed together like milk blooming in a teacup. Great metal men. Gunshots and missiles. Blood and guts and grime. The last combat memories of a pilot. I was a passenger. This was someone else’s body, someone else’s memories, it was being forced into my consciousness. I could feel it pressing in. I couldn’t look away. Mind spread like butter over an extending present that lingered onwards. The fidelity of the weapon systems I felt it all. It was me. I was every bullet, every shell, every spent casing. It was me. Then it was dark. 

The responses from the training data were encouraging. This one seemed to have reflexes. A lightweight machine could work with them. They were plugged into it and put back to sleep. The human supervisor looked through the logs for a moment and then gave it the green light. So it was that W4153 was born again in cold steel. Asleep and gone to the world. One of the lucky few to have been transported by coincidence back into life. The sludge at congealing and boiling back into nutrients at the bottom of the rethawing chamber a testimony to the luck. One of the lucky few to have not died in the catastrophes of the 21st century. A leap of faith into the unknown. It was just a bit further now. 

There was a sound louder than anything that had ever been heard. The sensory inputs were still being calibrated. W4153 was awoken by sound of the transport helicopter hurling them into the breach once more. The radio chatter was noise; it hadn’t been collated into any meaningful information yet. The feeling of consciousness itself intoxicating dancing atop the surface tension before dissolving into it. 

“Unit W4153 report?”

Something told them that was for them.

“Hello?” 

“Unit 4153 confirmed.” 

W4153. It didn’t feel familiar, but it was now what they were, it was whatever they had become now. They tried to look down but whatever body they had was paralyzed. The more they tried to induce any kind of movement the stranger it felt. There was the presence of a body, this time at least. No longer trapped within that of a stranger. 

“Confirm activation handoff.” 

The sound grew louder again, growing and growing until reaching the loudest it could. It didn’t seem to hurt. Their ears, they were never this sharp. 

“Core reaction acknowledged.” 

Then this time something flashed in front of their eyes. It was a map of a position. There were red dots all around. Then a blue box with arrows going towards it. They were going to assault a position. Just like that thing they were put through. It wasn’t a video; it was like having someone’s memories pressed into the crevasses of the brain. A frontal assault. They were to penetrate enemy positions and reach the objective. A fiber optic cable relay station at the top of a hill. There were automated enemy defenses between them at that objective. There were a few blue dots. A defensive line but it was far away. A dead zone in between and then a handful of assets that were expected to fight their way up the hill. There were maybe 20 other dots heading towards the dead zone. T6719, C8816, P7153, and so on. They were lit up. W4153 felt a rising fear which suddenly dissipated. As if a fan had turned on to blow away the smoke of fear. It was what it was. There wasn’t any other choice, no other means of locomotion. Besides the thought of getting up that hill, it felt good. It was going to go well. If anything, W4153 couldn’t wait to get on the ground with everyone else. It was going to be an easy assault. 

“Calling all troops of the 4th company, 4th brigade, 4th Mobile Infantry division, your mission is to assault the enemy base on the hill. Expect resistance. Good luck and may God bless your souls. God bless Atlantica.” 

The mic cut off. No indication on if the voice was the reanimated voice of a person, an AI, or if there was some office drone giving them commands. The transport helicopter began to descend as enemy resistance began. First the long-range fox one. The most expensive but also most effective. The sound of the engines surging now filled the transport chamber. As if trying to close the distance faster so minimal risk was undertaken by the transport. The smoke trails lit the blue sky, dancing across them and into targets. A rain of metal came from targets made good. Not W4153. Then the engine started to reel back. It descended to the ground. Lightening surged through the limbs as the body could move. It was not a body, not a human body, even if it were humanoid. The subject couldn’t wait. 

There was no vegetation, every last blade of grass had been seared away in hellfire. Shattered forests, and broken infrastructure the only proof of peacetime. A hail of dumb fire rockets passed overhead. Entering combat mode. The reassuring mechanical voice from within this machine characterized the situation. It was time to run wasn’t it. The engines of W4153’s metal skeleton began to spool themselves up. An otherworldly heat that they could not feel. Again, there was a feeling of something, that disappeared just as it started to form. Drugs started to cross the blood brain barrier. It was time. They couldn’t wait. 
Taking their first step they fell. Embarrassingly and instantly. Then a thousand warnings started to blare. They had been detected. A spider’s web of fiber optic cables from the command center were giving commands, and all of them were centered on W4153’s death. Standing upright again. They were closing, in seconds the metal and meat would again be unmarried and scattered onto this muddy field. Meaningless material to be scavenged and harvested, recycled again, torn apart again. Eventually finding the best iteration, the one that could stand the test of time. Dust and ash lining the petals of a far away daisy, miles behind the frontlines. Touched by the final stable configuration of many an ill begotten rethawed brain. Not today. Not for me. Not now. Please. I only just woke up. 

A crackle filled the air as the helo’s countermeasures sang out a prayer of salvation. There were another ten seconds. Have to get up, have to step up, can’t die here not after all that. The rolled steel skeleton creaked and rattled as it extricated itself from the mud. The motors surged, and then as the first drone of the second wave arrived it moved. Faster and faster, than even the eyes could ever see. Not that there were any eyes left to see. A single drone clipped, it was a dud. 5% of munitions were duds. The probabilities were piled high, a stack of cards all asking the single question with one voice. When will you run out of perfect. 

Not today. Not now. There would be a price to pay. You could put a thermometer in the protein soup that led to this second, and take a reading, and know that W4153 would survive that hit. The mud passed below at a speed unfathomable. The rocket motors burning blue. Plasma torching the ground. Revealing rolled steel embedded in the dead zone. The warnings started to go away, burned away by the plasma of that engine. Replaced with a single word repeated. Overspeed. Overspeed. Overspeed. W4153 modulated the speed to stop that annoying noise. For a moment they didn’t know where go to, then they smelt it, the smell of something warm, something sweet, something delightful, something that they couldn’t resist. They were in range of the direct fire high caliber canons the automated lock warning faded in and out, as the tremendous speed went beyond their tracking ability. Dumb fire automatic weapons began to crackle and fizz in the air hoping to gain a glancing blow. 

Too slow. As the centimeters of distance between the shells and the body mounted. The distance closed. They were in view now, the muzzle flashes. Now the close-range defense gatling canons, spewed out their song. Again, falling wide. They hit their mark on others; the blue lights went out. A handful lived on. Now it was close enough for W4153’s weapon systems to attempt a lock. It was easier on fixed emplacements than on the reverse. A surge of plasma fired into the direction. A flash as the target turned to dust. Then more and more guns went silent. Now they were close enough that the locks could stick. Flying into the air they jumped over then surging back. A stream of plasma contained in magnets surged from their right arm. They knew how to operate the blade. It crashed through the power supply for the sector. Each shot from the plasma pistol, every cut from the blade, that rang true triggered a surge of pleasure. Dopamine passed the blood brain barrier. Not enough to give total obliviating happiness but enough to hook the user on the battle. 

The guns went silent. They physically lost the ability to spin up their barrels. For a moment. Then the backup kicked into gear, but only for a moment until W4153 destroyed that too. There was now a sizeable hole developing in the defenses. Mobile units from both sides soon took notice as the drones started flying closer to home. At the same time, blue dots began to activate. The reserve forces suddenly called up. Surging like bacteria through a break in the skin. 
The drones had to divide targets in a desperate defense that heralded a shift in battlefield conditions. Now onto the second line W4153. There were no allies in visual range but no matter. They had made it this far alone already. What was a little more. 

The motor surged forward towards the next gun position, and the next, and then the last one. The only thing that changed was the sky. A cloud of spider silken threads connecting the command center to the drones in the sky. Blotting out the sun on this beautiful day. The cables connected to every element of the front. Every gun barrel, every drone, every virtual launch silo, all living and breathing connected parts of the same beast spewing fire from it. Now wounded, function lost as holes were punched through each line. Still even as the guns in one section went quiet, the rest would continue to sound in the distance. 
W4153 crested the hill. Tiredness spread through the brain, the only part of it to feel anything. The sun was fully covered by the dancing overhead cables. They came lower and lower to the ground. Some of them buried into the ground, snaking their way into emplacements miles away that were still sounding off. Yet all the bullets in the world would not save their commanding officer. The assembled thinking rocks in a concrete bunker. W4153 jumped into the air and gripped the tangle of cables. Gripping them, then ripping them apart. The pleasure again surged with the destruction. Drones falling dead. Ripping and ripping the skies apart. Until the blue could sing through. The sun could shine. Then they let go, impacting the bunker below. Frenzied steel tearing through the concrete until the structure could take no more. It collapsed in on the intruder and in on the sector commanding machine. The last feeling before the body entered recovery mode, was one of total pleasure filling the brain as it was lulled into sleep. 

The guns went silent. The hill was taken, and cleanup operations began in earnest. Resource extraction from the ground, every gun emplacement, every piece of burned-out slag, and every thread of fiber optic. In previous operations injured mechs had been left to rot but given the magazine was emptying their priority had been raised. The concrete would not become W4153’s final crypt. A few service mechs, able to buy their way out of the frontlines separated the twisted metal from the twisted concrete cocoon. The mech was non-serviceable but the core was still in good condition bereft neurotransmitters, drugs and glucose, but the brain was still in good condition. Still good for another mission. The only survivor among the first timers and quite a first timer among that.
