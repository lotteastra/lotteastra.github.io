# Chapter 1: Dissection

She hummed the words softly to herself. This is the day your life will
surely change. She fell into the decayed chair. A heart of wood and red
carpet, marble floors, and the rotting grandeur of a long-dead empire.
That was Whitehall, the office Whiskey found herself in. The department
for the North, Ministry of Event Management, Section 5, Artefacts. It
was a government position. Blood pumping through the heart nourishing
its gnarled frame. She was dressed in the best clothes she owned, an old
white shirt made for a man from a charity shop. Second hand slacks that
were too small for her. An oversized cardigan from her ex. There were
others stuck in the same temporal vortex. Waiting for their turn. One by
one. Some were dressed better, some worse. Some with stains. Some with
more egregiously ill-fitting clothes. She was in the bottom quartile of
style but that was not somewhere she was unfamiliar with. This was all
she had anyway. That and the memories that hold her life together like
glue.

They were all pushed deep into the bowels of the building to begin the
digestive process. Applicant by applicant chewed through. There was no
new infusion as the sun started to hang down in the sky. There was a
clear divide with the alts like her called out by ID numbers, and the
others being called out by names. Still, it gave her a kick seeing
normies forced to apply for the same dismal employment that she did,
chasing that office job, those comfortable hours. That thought chased by
a worry, that she would be passed over. She could not afford the luxury
of failure. At least being called a number was a kind of neutrality and
clarity. There were worst things she could be called by them.

Her ears heard her number before she did, and had already called up her
legs into motion. She stood up without even realizing it. She looked for
the person who said her name. Head moving, jerking around, ears atop her
head straining, black tail straight behind her. It took the person
moving her hand for her to see. All that time spent staring at the
passage every other applicant headed down, and not looking for where she
needed to go. Placing herself in the invisible pre-screening pecking
order.

She headed down the passage through some stairs and past a weary looking
security guard who did not spare her even a nod. She went upstairs and
down stairs and, she was already six feet under. Eventually reached a
chair outside a room with a low ceiling. The ornate woodwork carpentry
had become more functional as she descended deeper but the marble floors
and ornate carpets remained. The lanyard wearing woman who guided her
then went into the room behind her after gesturing towards the folding
black metal chair. Whiskey sat down feeling the cold of the chair. She
had no idea of what was in the room behind her, who her appraisers would
be. If they would think she was a pleasing pound of flesh. Her feet
tapped away. She tried to stay nervous. She knew that this job was more
for her than for anyone else. They did not put in the effort; they did
not know the pain that she did. They had other chances, other places to
go.

"Hi." A voice called out cheerfully from behind her. She stood up on
impulse again without thinking then awkwardly second-guessed herself.
"Oh, I'm just wondering if I could take a quick look at your papers if
that's alright." She was a little older than her using a casual tone of
someone embarrassed about their own age and authority. The woman's
surroundings made it stand out even more.

Whiskey took out her government ID, instead of a name she had a
designation W8194-HB, it had been branded into her memory through
repetition just as it had been branded into her as what she was to be
called by. Not Whiskey. Not by the old name that still haunted her. Not
by the impolite language reserved for her kind. The neutral clarity of a
number. "Here you go madam, Miss." She instantly felt awkwardly as the
word madam left her lips. Too formal for that woman. Whiskey awkwardly
started stretching the back of her neck.

"All in order." The woman said scanning it, her eyes clearly lingered on
the M under gender. Even when removed from personhood, the specter of
legal masculinity still haunted her. Whiskey still had not been given a
name for her. Shared namelessness, at least to Whiskey. "Please take a
seat, we will be with you shortly."

Whiskey slumped in the chair; she should have known that she was not to
stand up. She was tapping her feet but this time more sporadically. The
anxious rhythm attracting a glare from the security guard. She ceased
her movement. Her hands formed into fists. Her mind kept on reaching to
find some reason for why she felt so tense. This should be nothing, this
was her element. She knew all about it. She knew everything she had to.
She was steel, she was not wearing makeup, nothing expensive, she was
made of stronger stuff than that woman.

The door opened again and again she stood up, this time sure that she
was being called in. It was a man this time, bald, bespectacled, and
bearded. He looked at her for a moment before passing by and down one of
the winding venous corridors. She slumped back down again. Off balance
and wheeling from self-imposed embarrassment. The man came back in a few
minutes later. She was still waiting. She traced the carpet trying to
distract herself and this time succeeding. The beige color of the
carpet, and crème-colored walls, and the little gold cresting wave as
the carpet met the blue carpeted stairs.

The door opened again. She stood up again. The woman was there now.

"Please come in." She said.

This time instead of stumbling over titles she just nodded and went in.
The man was bald with a grey neatly trimmed beard.

"Hello. Welcome." He said with a kind of warmth. "Should we do
introductions or?" He looked over to her, she gave him a look. He
cleared his throat. "So you are a alt, sorry an altered human correct?
You mentioned in your letter that you first had contact with an artefact
at age 14, would you be able to tell me about that then. About your
experience with resonance artefacts in general. Your legal sex it was
male correct?" His eyes burned into her like a magnifying glass. She was
just an ant. His voice stayed flat.

"Yes sir." She paused. "Yes sir I have been altered." She left the rest
of it unaddressed. "The first time I saw an artefact was when I was 14,
it was during the event. There was all this noise everywhere. It was the
first time I ever saw a window break. First time I saw the walls come
down. I was afraid, but. I saw it. It was a different sound from the
rumbling outside. A high-pitched crackle. I can never forget all the
colors inside of it. I reached my hand out to touch it. The crackling
got louder and louder behind my ears. I can't really remember the rest
after that, but the artefact was contained."

"I see. That's hardly an atypical experience. You know we do get a lot
of applications from altered individuals, and often they have stories
like yours but not always. Go on tell me have you even ever felt the
resonance yourself."

"Sir?"

"Like I said go on."

"Well sir, this was before I was altered, but after that event I
developed a strong interest in artefacts, and that led me to visiting
the zone after the containment wind down. It was not exactly a
sanctioned visit, but it was the second time I encountered an artefact."

"Which zone, black? Red? Amber?"

"Red zone sir. It was when there was a wind-down of operations around
Bristol."

"Go on."

"Yes sir, I encountered an artefact. It was blue and it had a different
kind of crackle. I heard it without seeing it initially. The sound got
louder and louder and things started to, well spin sir. I felt the sound
crawling into me, into my spine. The second stretched out into an
endless moment that drowned me backwards. That was when I was altered."

"I see, so a second occurrence, how many times have you visited the
zone?"

"Five, no, six times in all sir."

"All red?"

"Black once, red three times, amber twice." She paused. "Sir."

"Quite well travelled then, so you're familiar with the different kinds
of things we tend to find in each part of the zone?"

"Yes sir."

"Have any blessings in you?"

"Yes sir. Ever since I was altered, I never a final end."

"You mean to tell me you cannot die."

"No sir."

"Have you tried?"

"Yes sir."

The woman stood up to interrupt. "Could you perhaps show us?"

"Helen, we can't ask her, we can't ask him to do something like that."
The bald man took back control.

"Hand me a gun." Whiskey said.

"This is not the time or place for that, I am quite sure you are
genuine." He paused. "It is not exactly outside the remit of what could
be expected from a blessing albeit a little more potent and immediately
useful than we usually see. That being said, I must ask, does it hurt?"

"Yes sir."

"Yes sir?"

"More than you'll ever know sir."

The interview carried on mentioning details about the job but those
words hung as a fog in the air. At the end handshakes were exchanged and
so the long wait would begin she thought. She left the office and was
directed back through the passageways by the weary security guard. The
lobby had mostly emptied out and all that was left was functionaries
busy with their own jobs. She signed out at the book before leaving the
place behind her. It was going to be a long and for her quite pricey bus
ride back to the Vauxhall apartment of her ex who she was still living
with. She hammered her body into the shape of every step forward. Until
a few months ago they were so happy then it all came down. It was lucky
that she was allowed to stay in the first place, the ex's small
benevolence. Those two years. She did not want to return but she had
nowhere else to go. As she crossed the threshold, she announced her
presence before settling in her nest. It was a black couch in the living
room with a grey blanket and a couple of couch cushions that had become
pillows.

Her ex was in the office down near the bedroom and deeper into the
apartment. The door was closed and locked as it always was. She liked to
tell herself it was because her ex was busy doing something sensitive,
the ex was an American associated with the ever-sprawling increasing
influence of that government. Always tapping away at the ex's hybrid
working job. The kind of job that would always remain under lock and
key. In her heart she knew however that the locked door was not because
of the ex's work. It was not because Whiskey could not face what lay
within, but because what lay within could not face her. The smothering
scummy presence she was. Too clingy, too worthless. Slag on a scrapheap.
She rested for a moment on the couch for a minute, she considered
reheating some dinner for herself but she did not feel hungry. She felt
sick. Her kidneys hurt her body ached. She reheated some for the
occupant beyond the door, leaving it outside the door and then settling
in for bed. Trying to shut out the smell before it made her vomit.

Sleep did not come easy. Her leg jostled for attention. With her
stomach. A live wire stinging her forcing her to move it every few
minutes. It carried on. She thought about the man and his expressions as
he dug around in her answers. She told herself that worrying was like
chewing gum to solve an equation but it did not stop her worries. It
never did. Eventually she fell asleep.

She woke up to the ex making coffee. She feigned sleeping until the door
was closed and the ex was on the way to the embassy complex. Whiskey put
on the TV and let the news wash over her. The weather was going to be
rainy all day, the perfect day to stay in and watch TV and wait to see
if any job offers came in the post. She had to get it she could not
avoid getting it. If she was denied she would have to live longer here,
on this couch. She could not go North her family did not want to see her
and she did not want to see them and aside from this couch she had
nowhere else to be. She had to get out, she reminded herself. She mused
as she entertained the possibility of rejection wargaming the scenario
in her head.

She needed a walk in the rain some kind of distraction from the
letterbox. She grabbed her coat and went out into the rain, checking
three times that the TV was off so she could avoid another confrontation
with the ex. She started walking across Vauxhall bridge. There were
soldiers and some kind of checkpoint nominally supposed to examine the
flow of people to and fro but they seemed largely content to ignore the
situation. White blood cells waiting and ready at the sign of an
infection but not bothering to look too closely at the crowd. The
haggard faces of every London worker white collar replaced with blue
collar, or green epilates, it was only really the artefact trade that
was booming. The only thing keeping the hum of civilization still
singing along.

She walked up through Westminster which was quieter than it had been
once. She remembered the civilizational crescendo the first time she
came before contact. This was where it all happened. Nowadays the
buildings had decayed, now cut off from the blood supply as Parliament
migrated north. The song of life migrated to the west or to the space
around the embassy. She walked into the west end, past looted Buckingham
palace and onto Oxford Street. Even post event life could not kill the
commercial heart of London, if anything it was busier now than ever.
There were rat skewers being sold at hawker stands, a relic of a time
when people were more desperate in the immediate aftermath and something
people had developed a taste for. Sausage rolls had migrated back down
south and had largely replaced rats for most people except the real
connoisseurs. Surplus MREs originally intended as food aid were being
sold for profit too. Never ignore the ability of a Brit to find a
captive market.

That being said the market stalls were no longer alone and some of the
old shop fronts had started to stir with new life. She looked out at a
cat café. Trying to avoid the gaze of the obvious alt waitstaff behind
the counter. There was something that hurt in seeing that. No, she could
not do a job like that. She was better than simple retail. Even an alt
like that there was no way they really knew anything about all of it.
They probably just fell into some artefact by chance. She had not been
delving in the dirt dealing artefacts to the highest bidder. That was
better than selling your own body directly anyway. Now a cushy job where
she did not know anything about anything. Whiskey would not let herself
fall into that. She needed where she could make all those years of time
and effort mean something she thought as she pulled her hands into
fists.

Walking back to the apartment she felt at points like she was walking to
the gallows. She could feel that rejection letter. The image of it
filled her with an electric dread that drowned out any other thoughts.
She wanted to vomit. Let it all out and fill her brain with distinct and
different sensations so she could ignore the pressure of dread. Then she
looked at her watch a cheap casio, if she did not get back soon there
would not be time for her to make dinner. The dread of dealing with the
ex animated her movements. She was home with about an hour to spare and
got to work on dinner. The fridge was well stocked which is something
that could not be said for most of the haggard faces on the bridge. She
started to make a curry, sautéing an onion in butter and adding the
curry powder, adding salt, more butter, and some more fresh vegetables
and a little bacon as a treat. It turned out well not that she expected
any praise. She made herself a small portion and then put the rest in
the fridge for the ex later and watched some light TV, a small luxury.
There was a whole program on artefacts and their industrial uses. It was
comforting. Then she turned on the baseball for a while. Trying to focus
on the batter, if he would make contact or not.

When the ex returned there was company there too. A girl hanging around,
tall. Less pretty than Whiskey but also an alt, cat ears and a short cat
tail with thinner orange hair. The ex gave a glare at Whiskey while
walking in and took the girl to the office. Whiskey did not want to
listen. They sounded so happy, they were laughing. Behind the locked
door. There was a time when Whiskey thought things could still be fixed
with the ex, it lasted a while until she got told she was smothering,
and told to go out for a walk. Since then, walks had been engrained in
her routine as a survival mechanism. Even digging through the dirt
looking for artefacts was better than this she thought while letting out
a sigh. She was a fire inside her own house, burning it all to ashes. It
was always her.

She needed to clean out the rooms.

# Chapter 2: Glucose

A letter fluttered through the letter box the next day. She knew what it
was, the dark black seal of the ministry emblazoned upon it. Inside was
a rejection letter but also an acceptance letter for a similar but
unrelated job. One bereft of the stable hours, and government prestige.
A job from Kent Holdings a company which provided cheap contract labor
to the government, a contract from them. Her eyes darted to the job
title of artefact analyst. She had wanted the government job. The office
job with nice hours and a regular schedule with Saturday Sunday off,
like the woman in her interview. To be given the authority of a long
dead crown on her pay slip and not a dollar bill. Given the
circumstances though, she could not reject. She would inhabit the
ministry's buildings, work with the ministry and do work for the
ministry while it denied and rebuked her. She could not wait to start.

So she spent the morning before training and signing the contract she
chiseled herself into the best version she could be. Combing her dark
hair and taking extra care to wash out the grease. This would be the day
her life would surely change. The office was once again six feet under
in the green zone of central London. It had once been ministry land but
now as the government receded it was office space for rent. The building
itself had seen years of decay and renewal since its being built in the
golden days of the empire.

Now it stood as all tombs do, ornate with golden cracks in its face.
Cracks dealt by the killing blow. Now all that remained was American
money filling the husk with life. These dollars would soon imbibe her
bank account. They would become her meals, her life blood, her bones in
time. So above as below. The manager was tall with brown hair. He looked
tired to his bones as the fresh meat filed in. Mostly normal people. As
she looked around she realized she was one of a handful of alts. The man
nodded counting up the fresh faces. He had a name lanyard around his
neck which read Tim.

"Okay, welcome everyone, I'm with Kent Holdings I'm here to introduce
you to your new career!" He spoke with the kind of enthusiasm that could
only be mustered by a paycheque motivated mid-level functionary. "So,
all of you are our latest artefact analysists, without you there, there
would be no-one to catalogue the zone artifacts!" His phrasing was
rehearsed but still clunky, a remarkable feat. "In today's training you
will learn how to handle our most common artefacts and how to categorize
them." As the details became more concrete his enthusiasm dropped
precipitously as his expertise faded from view. After all he knew all
there was to know about trying to sell the company. He explained the
pellet system, a paper record which was delivered with details of the
artifact she was to analyze. Where it was found and what tests were
recommended. He then explained some limited test procedures in vague
terms, measuring radiation, and using an atomic clock held at different
positions to analyze the time distortion. It was a different approach to
what she knew, one of measurements and reasoning and not the blood she
knew. All she knew was letting her mind fall into the resonance. Letting
the strange warm rocks, and other objects burrow their ways into the
synapses of her mind, rhyming with her thoughts as they were consumed
for a time. It was clear that the company approach was focused on volume
and mechanization, making the analysis as replaceable as possible. The
fresh meat was only here because metal arms brought too dear a cost and
this situation could only be maintained until silicone minds found a way
to make those arms cheaper.

The most common artefacts like her were given the clarity of numbers.
Devil's paste became Type 009. It did file away accuracy to describe
them as one number. If you had been in the field as she had you knew how
it was more a general family resemblance than that of identical twins
between artifacts. Even worse was how they changed over time, such that
a twin might one day lose resemblance with its twin. Then again that
expendability did make for a very marketable industry. A nodule at the
top of her spine purred to remind her of its place in her body, it's
family resemblance. Of what she owed her life to.

Then Tim launched into a rehearsed diatribe about higher level
artefacts, hot artefacts. How they were to told to read the pellet and
enter all that information into the hitherto fore unmentioned department
catalogue computer system and then ensure it was sent to the relevant
subdepartment. This was also advised for artefacts that were found to be
too hot to handle. At the end of the presentation a bundle of papers and
one lone sheet were passed around. One was a schedule, listing every
workplace and hours. 11am to 8pm on weekdays and 12pm to 9pm on
weekends, with Monday and Tuesday serving as a nominal weekend. She
would be working at the Ealing Evaluation center, which had taken over
the former town hall. She had wanted to stay around the center of the
city where the roads were safer and the symphony of civilization sounded
all the clearer. Yet the distance from the ex could be welcome. The
bundle of papers was a contract which was almost certainly slightly
different to the one sent with her acceptance offer. Yet she had no
luxury to dispute it and had not even read the original. Apparently, all
of the other alts saw the situation in much the same way as the other 30
sets of eyes in this place. Freshly signed schedules and contracts were
reaped from all of them. Whiskey clenched her hands into a fist. A smile
ran through her. She had finally made it somewhere at least. She would
not be some alt in the gutter, the artefacts embedded into her worth
more than the meat that surrounded them.

Moving apartment would be simple enough. The fastest internet speed was
now notice boards and payphones. Still, that was more the case for the
center. Out west the land value had bled away along with the people.
Driven out by beasts, artefacts, and thresholds. The event had been a
real disaster for insurers, landlords and estate agents. Many of whom
were now uncomfortably resettled in camps up north safe deep inside the
green zone. Where land had value and landlords ruled a thousand fiefs.
Instead of beasts and artefacts.

Cleaning out the rooms was easier than she had thought. Her whole life
spread between shoulder bag, military backpack and cheap wheel along
suitcase. The ex's domain lay within the office and as such Whiskey was
at liberty to take whatever she wanted. However, with the exception of
one pair of scissors, one tin of S&B curry powder and one jar of peanut
butter, and the blanket she lived in, she only took that which she had
brought in.

So she embarked on the long walk home to an unknown home. Each step
dragged. She could not see her feet beneath her. Stepping the long and
ragged road, feeling by feet alone. She traced the landmarks heading
west along the riverfront which had been so thoughtfully cleared of
development. Step by step and inch by inch her arms straining under the
weight of her world. There might have been busses once, taxis and cars
but out west save for the government and military maintained supply
routes there was no way for those without the ability to turn the
soldiers heads the other way. Besides the main routes were more crowded,
cumbersome and slower. She had decided she had to make her own way. Over
encumbered step after over incumbered step for miles. The river had
always been the best guide for in the city. It had guided many a soul to
make the city in the first place and still its flow guided any passerby.
At one point it had guided great wealth to the city and the river still
saw some traffic use to the east but the west was choked by military
cordons. It was her alone still being given guidance by the venerable
river. Soon she reached Hammersmith and the river curved up like an
elbow. This would be the place where she had to show her papers to pass.
The arms of the state stretching from the town hall down to the armpit
of the river flowing in.

The checkpoint was relatively quiet but of course as with any checkpoint
it was not without a line. The workers slowly let the traffic flow
through their plaque. The sign stood saying Passage to the Orange Zone
this way with an arrow pointing behind the checkpoint. There was another
sign too, Documents Ready which had the silhouette of a figure holding a
black square with ID written on it. She took out hers early but as she
went to do so her heart skipped a beat. Fingers groped unseeingly
gasping for the documents she needed in the front pocket of her bag but
with no success. It was in the second pocket flanked by her contract.
She let out a sigh of relief from the tension. She held the papers tight
her hands turning white as she approached the officer. As if the
documents were a shield of authority, holding the Kent Holdings logo
towards the officer as if some of the corporate authority could protect
her like a charm. The man had tired eyes. He did not take long to look
at her paperwork.

"Another one of those Kents then?" He said in a deep and deeply tired
voice blurring the line between Kent and Cunt. "What address might you
be headed to."

Whiskey felt the weight of those words press into her.

"Are you going to be in company housing same as the rest of them?" He
asked.

She should have read her contract and onboarding documentation more
clearly. As things stood though his presumption provided an easy escape
from this line of questioning.

"Well yes sir." Whiskey replied eagerly.

"Alright then here's your Orange Zone permit. Remember the rules on
artefacts before you come back through here, sir." The guard looked down
and hesitated before the sir but went through with it anyway deferring
to officialdom as all officials do.

She was jolted by the sir, but nodded and walked through. There was an
address on her permit. Most likely the company housing. It would be hard
to ascertain where the address was in the first place but either way her
first port of call would be the town hall. It was the most sensible
thing to do but she was not scheduled until tomorrow. She could goof off
and find any living pubs in the area. Spend the remainder of her money
on whores and whiskey, metaphorically speaking. It was a tempting
self-made preposition to buy some nice food and relax in the time before
work but she figured it made more sense to have fun after ensuring
everything was in its right place.

She continued her journey this time separating from the river and
staying nearer the Highstreet. It ran parallel to the great west road
and the military corridor therein. There was some foot traffic but
little interaction between travelers. This place was an interlude, one
track fading out into the next, as the symphony of central London faded
into disparate suburban dances. It took her four hours and the sun was
starting to hang in the sky. An anxiety she might arrive too late to
meet anyone at her new workplace danced in her heart before being
snuffed out. The town hall was the older building which still housed the
organs of state with a soldier stood outside. Her office was the next
building, a modern concrete amalgamation. She crossed the door. It was
quiet and it smelled a little like Mildew. Some corridors looked dustier
than others and by taking the road more travelled she felt her way
towards the Kent Holdings branch. Pasted the cracked concrete the
laboratory and office looked much more well maintained than the building
at large. Materials that flowed in from long supply chains to make a
clean modern interior. There was no-one in attendance at the front desk.
Obviously, she was no stranger to the strange sense of inoccupation in a
place begging for occupation but the sight of an open can of red bull
without a crown of dust was disquieting.

As if summoned by her thoughts there was a noise from down the corridor
outside the office and it rumbled closer. It was a man, bearded, stocky
with a lanyard around his neck. Detective Inspector Clark Mortazavi. He
had a government black seal. She put down her bags near the entrance.

"You don't know where the rest of your coworkers are do you?" He asked.

"No, actually I'm meant to start tomorrow so I don't really know any of
them." Whiskey replied her head moving slightly to the right.

"Those fuckers are always like this keeping everyone waiting. He said
with a sigh. "We gotta at least look around for them you know I guess."
He said with another sigh and held his hand as he concluded an internal
debate.

She gave a nod and followed deeper into the branch. Obviously, there was
the ghostly reception but past that there was an atrium and the first
room labelled deliveries. There had been some life in this room until
recently. A choir with hymn sheets but none of the faithful to sing.
With boxes and delivery labels strewn about the place. The next room was
labelled examination room two and had all of its requisite tools and
writing implements all put away neatly. It had not been used recently
they both silently concluded. Exam room one was the last place for them
to look. The last possible place. They could be held up in there having
a silent sort of break but she doubted it. Her ears twitched and then
she felt it. The buzzing at the back of her ear goading her to open the
door to cross the threshold.

"God fucking damn it." Clark held his head in his hands for a second
before prying them away to move like a marionette. "Well actually
outsourcing to private industry in our case makes sense." He energy
drained out of him as he did an upbeat imitation of someone Whiskey did
not know. "God." He sighed again.

Whiskey stood back for a second digesting the situation. "You got any
artefacts on you sir" I think we're dealing with a can opener behind
there." She said plainly.

"Yeah, ugh, that'll be it." Clark said again assailed by sighs. "Well
little artecorp alt, you seem to know better than your coworkers if you
ever even get to meet them." Clark said with a sardonic laugh.

"You got a file?" She asked.

"I guess I don't carry one around for nothing." He took out a jagged red
rock contained within a home-made walkie talkie contraption. Despite
appearances it was reasonably standard issue. He looked at her for a
moment as he asked a silent question. Do you want to call it in and wait
for help, do you want me to do it?" Earnest eyes looked with a silent
sort of care.

"Let me hook into it. What does it beat to?" Whiskey said clearing the
air.

"It's a 1-2-3, second by second beat."

He nodded and started to unscrew the knob. The air began to dance
counting one two three, etching each number with tremendous energy
filling the room. The energy too making the base of her skull tremble.
Each number now filtering through into her mind. She could barely think.

"Keep that on." She shouted above the noise as the air could barely hold
any more vibration.

She approached the nondescript wooden office door and took the handle.
She looked back and gave her a nod. She stopped for a moment verifying
to herself that she was going to do this. She gripped the handle so
tight it seared into her before pushing the door forward and crossing
the threshold.

# Chapter 3: Incisor

The room was dark except the dancing static in the middle, there was a
table, but like a pond of bright light, the threshold beckoned. The
temperature outside and inside in discordant ignorance of each other.
She was starting to sweat from the temperature now. There were three
bodies face down propped up by caught limbs, faces below the floor,
bathing in a sea of static. Not like she had any of the tools that would
have made this easy on her, all long sold to shady arms dealers,
digested by the economy and spitting life into her. She approached the
threshold like it were a pool. Knees together she took a deep breath out
of reflex not need and then took the plunge. It was so tremendously
bright. Brighter than bright and so hot it felt cold. Memories were
leaking from the delirious faces as their minds, untethered from the
body bled white. The binder was starting to fill the space the sound of
the numbers fighting against the combined sounds of anything the ear
could hear. Impressing reality onto them.

Then there were the faces, every expression a face could show was
pressed into them by the relentless static. Around them all a collage of
themselves. Faces Whiskey had no way of knowing slowly being drowned in
airless delirium. She counted to herself, tracing the beat of the binder
1-2-3. Numbers as a ward against the tide of meaninglessness. Counting
seconds in a time out of time to maintain the meaning of a second. A
simple thought repeated with enough strength and simplicity to drown it
out of her ears. Still the base of her skull trembled with the pulses of
an artefact infinitely close and infinitely far. It's okay, nothing she
had not done before. Something she had done for a long time. She could
do this. She would not get trapped in here. She did not want to be. This
time.

Complex thoughts returning to her brain. Her grip was starting to slip
as the colors around her started to contort themselves into memories.
Every thought she would ever think stood as the enemy at the gates. What
am I doing. Thinking I could just jump in. A creeping dominating
insecurity that was going to eat her. One two three, one two three,
breathe, breathe, breathe. The first person was a girl with light
brown-red hair. Whiskey took her hand and then went for the next one an
alt. The last one was a man far away. She only had two arms. In this
world of energy she briefly considered imagining herself another arm,
inviting the energy into herself letting it fill her body her mind.
There would not be enough time to do it perfect. She could not. She
focused her eyes and pushed against a self-imagined floor; with legs she
clung to against the static. The static danced against her the jaws were
starting to close she could feel it. Faster and faster. Trying to
navigate her way out of a meaningless maze.

The room on the other side was sterile except from the blood that gushed
from a half body. Whiskey for her part had cuts all over her legs. Small
and superficial bite marks of reality reasserted. She was holding hands
with the two sleeping beauties still breathing. Not a hair on their
heads had been hurt. Clark wore a strange face as he looked at Whiskey.
Confusion, relief, and anxiety all in equal measure.

"What are you looking at." She said. The file was still in his hands
having just been restrained. "Get a mop, get a bucket, and call it in."

"You think I didn't call it in first thing?" He asked perplexed.

"Just making sure." She said. "Do you need help getting them out of
here?" She asked presuming he would move them from the expanding pool of
blood and viscera. He was the bigger of their number.

"Right." He said with a sigh before shouldering them.

Whiskey stood up and felt her legs stinging. There was still a faint
buzzing. Where the man's hips met the ground, a green jagged rock poked
out.

"You got a container?" She asked.

"No, but the boys should have one when they get here. I called them a
couple of hours ago now." He said sighing again.

"I was under two hours in there? Not too bad." She said. After all some
people had spent hears within a threshold. She shook involuntarily at
the thought, the artefact at the base of her brain pulsing.

"It was loud having a file like that blaring all that time. You'd have
thought I'd gone deaf." He said.

"You could have left. Anyway the container there's a second artefact
near the half man. I don't know what it is." She paused and her ears
twitched. She heard it pulsing nice and easy. "It sounds stable."

Then as if to prove her wrong in front of him the air started to fill.
Her ears darted involuntarily towards the sound but it was not that
green rock, it was the crate on the desk. Drop and run was her first
thought but before her brain could process self-preservation her hands
were already around the crate. Her muscles were tensing, her calves
bent. There was only legs and muscle in motion. Meat in motion,
motionless half man. Her eyes were already looking for a room to drop
and run from the little box of horrors. Down the corridor the space
around her started to fill with sound. A beckoning temporal delirium.
There was an old waiting room full of dusty stale air. She dropped and
ran and as she crossed the door the room flashed with brilliant light,
she sweated from the sudden increase in temperature. She had just made
it.

She swaggered back to the branch. Clark looked dumbfounded. "Well, that
was just fine wasn't it." He looked at her trying to make some
reprimand.

"The new artefact it could've interacted badly with it." She looked for
justification 2. "Also he could have been, you know the body."

He looked at her with a face of resigned anger.

"I know you think I'm stupid." She said.

"Whatever." He pressed the mop into her and sighed. "Come on. Let's get
on with it."

She nodded.

The blood had pooled looking much like the static threshold. The wound
resembling its own cause. She had never gotten a clear look at him and
any photo would be seen through the lens of the twisted bloody torso.
She had always heard about how much blood the body had. How many miles
the guts could run for if laid out. Those numbers felt meaningless as
the guts stretched out. Shit and pennies. It could not have been longer
than fifteen minutes to clean up half his life blood. It could have only
been like this was what she told herself. Letting it in, losing her
shape in that void. There would be four half bodies bleeding out had she
done so.

"I guess it'll be for the boys to do the rest then." She said.

"Already on their way, I'm pretty sure they'll have a corporate
representative with them." He said simply. "What a way to start working
huh." He slapped her back.

"Yeah I guess."

"I wonder what it does." He gestured to the object.

"It's really not that active." She looked over at it again. Now it was
yellow and still jagged but forming itself into a cup.

There was a stir from the lobby. The seating area repurposed for the two
co-workers. Clark and Whiskey got up and prepared for the inevitable.
The girl with red brown hair was the first with a deep visceral scream
which petered out quickly. Clark knelt down in front of her.

"You're okay. It's okay." Clark said.

The air was filled with her deep breaths and the breaths of the sleeping
altie.

"Miss what's your name." As he looked for a lanyard. Then he turned for
a second and started again. "You're here at your work it's been between
two and three hours, you live in London in Ealing and you have wonderful
long hair." He spoke so softly Whiskey thought.

The girl replied with a bug eyed glare but gradually as meaning returned
to her mind she started to come back.

"I'm Jessica, so I guess I'm still on the clock then if it's only been
that long."

"Probably but you shouldn't get up too quickly. Easy, easy." Clark said.

"I guess if they're going to dock my pay anyway for the branch closure."
She said with a sigh. She got up to sit properly in a chair.

"Where's Mark." She said looking around.

The name, the half torso, the sudden pull on Whiskey's stomach. Clark
sat for a moment trying to formulate a response. Jessica tried to read
his face and then Whiskey's. Silence filled the room.

She answered her own question. "He's just in the back right? I mean it
was his idea, dealing with that one, he knew what to do right." She said
calmly but authoritatively.

Clark tried to go around finding the right words. Whiskey stayed quiet.
There was nothing there she wanted to say for now. The silence was
kinder than anything else.

"How long had you known Mark." Clark asked.

"Maybe about 8 months, he'd been at the company longer." She spoke
simply.

Clark spent a minute trying to calibrate this new information into the
line he was concocting but Whiskey couldn't wait anymore.

"I'm sorry but it's really your own fault if you go asking questions you
don't want the answers to." Whiskey said. Her gut sank for a moment.

"I see." Jessica replied simply. "Makes sense."

A less weighty silence bled of its overhanging anticipation followed
before the start of the second scream. This one was longer and more
strained. Her voice started to crackle burned away by its own length.
She screamed her lungs out trying to expel meaningless memories like a
drowned swimmer. Then her head darted around the room scanning the new
faces and Jessica.

Before Clark could say anything she had opened her mouth to start
babbling. "Where's am I is Mark?" She asked. The first words stumbling
foal like from her lips. Clark looked down at her name lanyard.

"It's okay, you're okay, hello Skye, you live in London, you live in
Ealing, you work for Kent holdings and you have dirty blonde hair, mouse
ears and a thin tail." Again his soft voice trying to cushion her fall
back into reality. "The time is 4:56pm." He said looking at his watch,
which was in military time.

She held her head for a minute. "Who are you?"

"I'm Clark, Clark Mortazavi." He spoke with a slight embarrassment. "I'm
a detective inspector. I'm here to help." He did so with the un
warranted confidence of his own authoritative title in his eyes.

Whiskey felt a twang of resentment ripple in her stomach. He had barely
helped at all. She swallowed it down. He did put out the file even if it
was mostly all her.

"Good morning Skye." Whiskey said with a smile and interrupting Clark
and Skye.

The girl looked over scanning Whiskey with her bright blue eyes. "I'm
sorry but who are you?"

"The name's Whiskey don't wear it out." She said with a smile smug and
forced and unearned. The smile of a hero waiting for their adoring
crowd.

"You're altered too." Skye said simply. "Where's the guy, sorry I'm just
wondering."

"He's gone Skye." Said Jessica.

"Oh right yeah uh." Even after waking up the words, she chose stumbled
awkwardly as they filled the room. "I heard actually did you know that
artefact analysists are usually safer than scavengers and redeemers. If
you read the statistics actually it's clear that. Sorry." She spoke with
an awkward laugh leaving her thought unfinished.

"In about 20 minutes from now a cleanup and debrief team will be
arriving so we are to sit tight till then." Clark said.

Sky and Jessica nodded and then he looked over at Whiskey. "That goes
for you too you mangy cat."

"Who are you calling mangy? I'm not the one with the scraggly beard and
beer belly." Whiskey said with a laugh.

"You'll have a beer belly soon enough working this job." Clark said.

"Whatever dude." Whiskey shot back.

Jessica interrupted the playground squabbles with a question. "Can I
smoke here now?" She asked, a pink Bic lighter and menthol cigarettes in
hand.

"It's probably not legal still and look I don't care but your manager
will care if he smells smoke but you know it's up to you." Clark said.
"Though I could really go for a smoke. Hey cat, you smoke too?" He asked

"Today's the day for it." She said with a smile.

"Skye?" Clark turned and asked.

"Well actually I'm sorry but I've never smoked and I think it's a bit
smelly and gross even when Jess smokes her ones, they smell weird." Skye
meandered.

"Well, 3-1 let's get out of here a sec and take a quick smoke break." He
gestured out and led the way, then Jess, Skye and Whiskey holding the
rear.

Whiskey started to awkwardly fumble for her lighter before finding it.
The nice firm construction of a zippo lighter in her hands. They lined
up against the concrete with Skye standing a bit away from them. Even
the end of Britain could not kill the Anglo-American tobacco company.
Regular Marlboro reds for the detective, Marlboro lights for the cat,
and self-rolled menthols for the girl. Whiskey panicked a moment hoping
that she had remembered to fuel her lighter, after a few agonizing
clicks it lit. Clark was already underway and so was Jessica. There was
her first long drag. She could hear a slight crackle from the tiny
flame. Then like all the muck in her soul was being expelled she
exhaled. As if the toxic smoke could replace it all. They stood in
silence. Clark was done first, then Whiskey and then Jessica. The sun
started to set and the cold was coming in.

Clark looked at his watch and waited, they would be here soon, no point
in going back in. He just let the smoke hang in the air a few minutes.
Then the convoy arrived, one military truck and one grey sedan. A column
of tired eyes. They advanced into the building with Clark but the three
employees were left standing listless outside to be debriefed by a
manager with the same tacky colored Kent Lanyard. It was Tim again from
training.

He stood up with a strange smile stretched by contorted muscles in his
face and absent from his eyes.

"Okay everyone hello!" He was disgustingly upbeat. "Welcome Whiskey,
sounds like you had an eventful first day of work." He said laughing at
himself. "So, I heard that there had been a little bit of an issue here,
there have been a couple of branches, actually. So sometimes the pellets
we get they can have a couple of issues here and there you know. So we
need to be really careful and remember that safety is number one. Call
things in if there is any indication of anything going wrong okay?" His
intonation rose to a dizzying high at the end. His words strangling any
potential conflict in the crib. "Oh and smoking, so there have been some
complaints from customers about some of our workers smelling like smoke,
so if you could refrain from it while on the clock." As though these
problems were of equal importance. Everyone gave him a nod in response
as they were lined up in front of the wall.

"Okay so also welcome Whiskey, so you're signed up for the company
housing right?" He said stepping towards the group of them a little. "So
everyone else will be able to direct you."

As he stepped forward he counted them. "Where's Mark?" He asked. "So is
he?"

Silence filled the void of an answer, Tim breathed in for a moment,
before smiling again. He took out a notepad and made a note.

"Then, I guess we can get you moved in, Whiskey. I'm going to take
inventory in a minute. Come on, lets help two can help him to his new
room. Here's your new key! He said holding them out towards her." Tim
nodded at Skye and Jessica

Hearing the stray pronoun shot through her nerves. A flash of sudden
pain that made her recoil. They went back into the building towards the
branch, the door was closed but just outside was a neat pile of bags.
Her life in three bags. The men walked out with half a life in one bag.
She shouldered her bags and Skye decided to linger but Jessica directed
her towards the company housing. It was a small set of terraced houses
that had undergone some degree of restoration, all in a row. They had
likely been spared much of the wounds of anywhere else, and any
superficial perforations had been healed. She held out the keys, around
here there were few homes with keys. She pressed it into her thumb.

"This one should be yours. Well it might be." Said Jessica as they
walked up towards an orange house that was one offset from the end.
Whiskey fiddled with the keys but they did not seem to fit right. "Tim
probably screwed up with the keys, I guess I'm not surprised." She said
with a smug laugh.

"Are you sure this is it." Whiskey asked.

"Yeah, he just gave you the wrong keys, it's probably unlocked anyway."
She pushed down on the handle and laughed at Whiskey. "See, it was open
all along."

Inside there were signs of recent habitation, a coat hung on a hook.
Chairs strewn around, a mattress, a book open on a page.

"Are you sure this is supposed to be so furnished?" Whiskey asked.

"That's weird, maybe." Jessica stepped forward a bit but still behind
Whiskey. "Oh." She made the noise. "This must be." The silence completed
the sentence.

There was the shape of a man, an outline in chalk around his
possessions. His skin still filled the air. Cloaked in the air, the
rotting DNA of a dead man. The remains of days old skin cells being the
only part of him that would once again cross the threshold of this
place. Nothing besides remained. They left that place cloaked in the
same self-completing silence.

"So, you must be this one." She gestured towards the end of terrace. A
white townhouse.

Whiskey walked up to the door. The key fit this time. Crossing the
threshold into an empty pair of lungs. There was no furniture. Wooden
floor and white walls. A toilet but nothing else. None of the
life-making conveniences.

"I guess he did give you the right key huh." Jessica said.

Whiskey nodded. It smelled dry inside, clean inside.

Jessica gave an awkward look around. "I guess I'll leave you to it. I'll
see you at work tomorrow, remember your shift, 11am." As she made her
way to leave Whiskey turned towards her.

"Wait." She said with a hint of desperation.

Jessica turned back. "Hmm?"

"Where am I supposed to sleep? There aren't any curtains either. It's
too bright." Whiskey asked without knowing what to do. An innocent look
on her face. "I could make do but." She was more addicted to the
creature comforts of an American salary than she could ever admit. Her
rough and tumble personality tumbling apart with her actions. The single
step and outstretched desperate arm.

"Well." Jessica said. Letting her word hang in the air. "We could go
looking around there are always old things in old houses, left behind,
it might be a bit of a trek though, this area has mostly been picked
clean last time Skye and I checked but."

"I don't mind going a bit far I suppose." Whiskey said not realizing the
implication.

"This is such a horrible thing to say." Jessica said.

That utterance made Whiskey realize. Crystalizing the thought. Really
there was nothing else for it. Every day more and more of the orange
zone had whatever was useful picked out of it. As the waves of safety
carried away anything of value. Condensing the city into its core. There
really was no telling how far away a mattress would be, and the cost of
transportation if she had to go as far to buy from the markets the
furniture that had been picked clean. Money, she did not have right now.
Really there was nothing else for it. There were no other methods. Not
if she headed towards the center anyway, but heading further away that
was its own risks and how far would she go to risk herself to avoid
being haunted and cursed for graverobbing. The possibility of
superstition more seductive than the probability of running into some
nasty orphaned artefact, or worse.

"We could go and retrieve his mattress from his house. It's not like
he'll be using it anymore." Whiskey giving shape to the allusion.

"Yeah. You're right." Handing over the responsibility for who came up
with the idea.

The shared agreement of complicity as they headed to rob the house.
Still they could not bring themselves to speak in his house. As though
they were robbing from a man sleeping upstairs. In a way they were. The
bed he had was a simple mattress on a floor and a few blankets strewn
around. It was old and had been taken from some other house. Probably a
while ago when there was more to take and more danger in the taking
around here. They also found blackout curtains and as they carted them
over they made one last pass. Whiskey looked at the book on the table.
Do androids dream of electric sheep, by Phillip K Dick. She took the
book for her own. Whiskey thought to herself. A table and a small wooden
sofa were also pilfered. Then some cooking tools. All the necessary
tools for life somewhere. At the end of their shopping spree they were
both tired as Jessica took some things back to her own apartment.

"Thanks for the help." Whiskey said.

"Not really, besides it's not like you didn't help me take- get a thing
or two myself." Jessica said.

"It was my pleasure." Whiskey replied.

"Your pleasure to rob a dead man wow. Even his book, can't his ghost be
given any entertainment." She said starting to laugh.

"Dead men read no tales Jessica." Whiskey said wagging her finger.

"What about undead men? What if he's going to be haunting his own
house." Jessica replied back.

"Well if he's haunting anyone he's probably haunting me, after all I
stole his previous resting place." Whiskey gestured as though to a
crowd.

Jessica laughed. "We're so terrible."

"If we weren't terrible we wouldn't go grave robbing." Whiskey said.

"No. We're terrible because we went grave robbing then we started joking
about it." Jessica said the laughter stopping.

"Well." Whiskey stood there for a moment. "We are terrible people,
terribly, going to. Going to terribly enjoy our new creature comforts
without being haunted."

Jessica gave a laugh. "That doesn't really work."

"I know." Whiskey replied with a smile.

"I'll see you tomorrow, Whiskey." Jessica said with a wave. Whiskey
waved back.

Whiskey crossed the threshold into her new abode. Her first abode.
Permanent and solid and all hers. Not hers. It was the company's house.
None of the furniture here was hers. All that was hers was her life in
three bags. The mattress was not hers. He still clung to it. It was all
over it. The dust, his skin. Something that could only be found in two
places in this world. All that remains of a life, bagged and scattered.
She starred up at the unknown ceiling. She dissolved into sleep, as the
last microorganisms processed the last chunks of that man.

# Chapter 4: Intravenous

The first day on the job. She chiseled her legs into walking the ten
minutes or so to the town hall. She wormed her way into the corridors
and past the room with the threshold thrashing away. Held back by a
brown wooden door and a sign behind it. Orphan artefact it read. She
wondered about passing the door. Descending again into its depths. Her
hand contorted around the door handle. Those two years of empty sweet
nothing called to her like an old lover from the end of the receiver.
The dangling enticing light of an angler fish. Coaxing her towards.

"Morning." Said Jessica with a wave.

Whiskey turned towards her. "Good morning." With a particular three
finger wave she held up towards her head.

"They really cleaned everything up quickly didn't they." She gestured at
the building.

Whiskey had not noticed but it was true, the dust itself seemed to have
been disturbed and driven off by the commotion. A shabbiness held back
by life bubbling away in the building's halls.

"I suppose." Whiskey responded.

"They came this morning too. They cleaned it out. I guess it's good that
we got what we could, before it was all sold off or dumped." Jessica
said.

"Probably dumped." Whiskey said simply. Nothing besides remained of that
man.

"This company? They'll try to squeeze out every last pound. Anything
they can take. Everything they can take from you. That's just how they
are." Jessica said.

"It's usually cheaper to dump nowadays, finding a buyer and the cost of
time and selling it in its own way." Whiskey said. "So, we're not even
worth it, there are no extra parts to be reprocessed. There is only the
scrapheap."

"I guess so." Jessica said.

Silence crept in for a moment. As they both wondered into thinking of
the man on the scrapheap. The half man. Materially excised from being.
Whiskey trembled for a moment. Should she say sorry. The guilt was
starting to eat her thoughts. Chewing and spitting her out. Her hands
trembled in the mouth of her feelings.

"I don't want to work today." Jessica said. "I'm killing myself."

Whiskey looked her up and down as she said it simply but with a smile.

"Is it really that bad anyway?" Whiskey asked simply.

They started walking towards the office and talking.

"I guess it's not that bad. I've done worse, I've done better." Jessica
said.

"That Tim guy is interesting." Whiskey said.

"He's not very good at his job." Jessica replied. "Though he rarely
shows up here."

"I see. That's a relief then." Whiskey said.

They crossed into the branch. It was even cleaner than yesterday,
whatever contractors they had made short work of the place. Skye was
already sat down behind the front desk. She had a computer in front of
her that she was going through.

"Morning." Skye said looking up for a minute.

Whiskey gave a thumb and two finger wave before continuing towards her
desk while Jessica replied and started talking to Skye. The front was
arranged with two desks, one in front and one behind. On the second desk
there were two chairs for Jessica and Whiskey with a clipboard sitting
on the table. Whiskey took a look at it. It was expected deliveries
throughout the day and the kinds of artefacts to be examined. Devil
paste, devil paste, stopper, file, listed on her schedule. She let out a
sigh as the minutes started to count down towards the start of the work
day. She took out her book and started to read for the scant few minutes
she had.

"Um Whiskey it's um, time so, I think it's already in examination room
one." Skye said.

Whiskey nodded back.

"Ugh." Jessica said as she made her way to exam room two.

As Whiskey walked in she saw the huge wooden crate standing alone on the
table. She looked at the pellet for it. Devil paste straight from
Bristol, fairly by the numbers stuff. Her artefact at the base of her
skull seemed to pulse a little with it. She took out the examination
gloves. They were new but also cheap. Still any barrier to keep that
stuff from her skin would be nice. She put her hand in it feeling for
any solid particles and noting the consistency of it. It was more on the
liquid side compared to some varieties and had a slight pinkish hue. The
smell was unmistakable though. Ozone through the air. Next was to test
the friction of it. The best varieties of devil paste she had seen could
minimize friction to practically nothing. There was a tribometer in the
corner and as she let the paste fall harmlessly through her fingers she
gathered a sample in a syringe. It was a tricky material to work with
not least because it did not adhere to anything. Except human any human
cells that is. As she went over to the tribometer she noticed that the
tip that read the friction did not have anything to adhere the sample.
She took a cotton swab to the inside of her cheek and applied it to the
tip. Then the syringe. Then she set the machine to run.

It was a relatively standard batch reducing friction from the control by
about two thirds. Not perfect but far from nothing. This scientific
miracle which crawled from a toxic hole in the middle of western
England. She took out a timer and waited ten minutes before testing
again. This time to measure the stability in the batch. It was the same.
A good batch or at least relatively stable.

The next batch proceeded the same way, swab, tribometer, record. There
was an awful lot of devil's paste. Soon enough it was lunch break unpaid
of course. She left the examination room. Both of the other girls seemed
to have already taken off and again the room was filled with the empty
sense of people who until recently were there.

The back of her neck it pulsed. She could feel the threshold just across
the room calling out to her. Lacking anything to eat for lunch perhaps
she could satiate her desire for sensation across the way. Why not. It
was something she had done before. She could time it. Pull herself back
out. She looked around the cupboards for something to use as a binder
would have been nice. It did not take her long. There was a military
radio, standard issue but still reasonably new. It had to be from the
cleanup crew yesterday. Strewn around as the last remains of the squad.
She turned it on and it was already tuned to the frequency they used.
What an easy way to listen into their communications. Shame she was just
using it as a tool to get her fix. A silver spoon taken from a celebrity
chef.

The hum of comings and goings and status reports would pave her way
back. She took it to the room. It was hot. It was loud. It was all over
everything. There was nothing that was not the threshold. She paused at
the edge. Her hands gripping the edge of reality. Then she lent forward.
It was an instant it was everything it was all the time in the world
that swept her up in a wave. She was subsumed. The faint sound of
military checkpoints the only shell to keep herself from spilling into
the energy. Yet still through the semi permeable membrane meaning she
clad herself in she could feel it. The tide. The delightful feeling of
everything at once. Every nerve filling with sensation. She could get
lost again in it. The jaws opened and closed above. If she mistimed it
she could get decapitated. If she mistimed it she could get fired. At
least getting decapitated would bleed all meaning from being fired just
as it bled all meaning from her corpse. A meaningless pile of meat. A
meaningless mass of energy wrapping her away singing sweet nothings into
a permanent end.

She did not know the time. It felt like only seconds. Minutes maybe.
Hours and years maybe. There was only now. Part of her brain tugged at
her. If the radio slipped she would lose it all. She struggled her way
out. Coming back to the surface. Sweat clung to her as the exhilaration
faded and the pain returned. What was she doing again. This pointless
dance of meaningless nothing. It was a moment or respite from reality.
Now she was swept back up in a different wave. She clung to the door
handle. She was iron. Like the handle. She would endure. She told
herself that. Until the tears stopped.

"You're a little uh late." Said Skye with an awkward laugh as Whiskey
walked back in.

She nodded. Looked at her watch. She was three minutes late. She was
good. She was still whole.

Jessica looked up at her. She gave a look that seemed confused as she
tried to decode the expression on Whiskey's face, before giving up.

The next artefact rolled in. It was a battery. These things rolled in
fairly often and were simpler to study than devil's paste. Something
mercifully easy at least. She just hooked it up to a voltmeter. Then she
tested it with an ammeter. Then she waited to see if the current or
voltage changed and if so by how much. Then she tested different wires
and interfaces. It was electrical work sure, but it did not feel as
dangerous to her. It was a known quantity. Then the day rolled onto its
end. The end of her first day. Skye was the one who was responsible for
closing shop by the looks.

Jessica stood by the exit with a bag and coat wrapped around her. Along
with a lighter and some cigarettes. She looked over at Whiskey as she
made her way to leave.

"Hey, want a smoke?" Jessica asked.

"Why? And besides I don't have any on me." Whiskey replied.

"I can give you one. Besides it's your first day, you know." Jessica was
tired but trying to create some kind of enthusiasm.

"I could do one." One being the number of cigarettes Whiskey could take
without feeling guilty. "But I'll pay you back, I promise."

"Okay." Jessica said plainly.

They walked outside to where they had yesterday. That concrete façade
where the cigarette butts marked their place.

"How was lunch today? Did you get to explore the area at all?" Jessica
asked.

"Oh uh I didn't do a whole lot, I mostly stayed in the old town hall."
Whiskey replied trying to play off awkwardness as being casual.

"There's some stalls a bit away you know. They do some nice deals. We
should go." Jessica said.

Whiskey stood there trying to figure out if she had been exposed for her
illicit activities or not. Jessica stared at her again. Whiskey
instinctively started scratching the back of her neck as silence started
to creep in.

"Oh yeah, how is your room." Jessica asked.

"It's fine. It's plain, it's pretty clean. One of the cleanest rooms
I've ever lived in. The mattress is comfy too. Thanks for helping me out
with it yesterday." Whiskey said with the biggest smile she could tease
from herself.

"It wasn't doing any good just sitting there." Jessica said. "Before I
got here, I was doing odd jobs in the green zone you know. I worked as a
waitress, I worked at a care home, I worked the army kitchens."

"Why'd you come to work with artefacts?" Whiskey asked without even
thinking the question bypassing her brain.

"I'd always been interested in them. My dad he was in the army, and he
was always talking about what they found you know. Curiosity and the cat
and all." Jessica said gesturing around.

Even with all of the options in the world someone else ended up here
just the same. At this dingy suburb of a city bled dry bleeding your
days away to a job that could well kill you.

"They are something else. How long have you been here?" Whiskey asked.

"Like a year now. Same old same old categorization work though nowadays
I work on the pickles and send them off. It's way easier than
categorization itself and a bit safer too. Once you've been here a few
months you should see if they could train you up for it. I mean the
training is a joke." Jessica said. "You know my mum went crazy when I
told her I took this job. Telling me I'll be eaten by some beast down
here. She was okay with it in the end though. I wasn't the first one of
us to work on them after all and I was always dad's favorite, so he was
able to get her to get it."

Whiskey nodded. She took the last puff of her cigarette. A whole
conversation where she could avoid talking about herself. Good job. Good
job for saving this girl too. It was her after all. A girl full of
thoughts and people who cared about her somewhere. Not an artefact
embedded in her. Her value was not given by the state, by an artefact
classification board, by a cv. Whiskey felt like she needed another
cigarette as the that thought made contact with her brain. A strobing
wire burning into already fried circuits. She was normal.

"I should get going." The words stumbled out of Whiskey. She wanted to
talk about it. About what hung over her. She wanted to but she could
not. She was better than that. Better than burdening other people with
the weight of her problems. What good would it do. To shock them, to
burn them.

"We live right next to each other. We can talk and walk." Jessica said
with a smile.

Whiskey nodded.

"The company can be unforgiving. One time I was sick, so I went into
town to get a doctors note which took forever since there aren't any
good clinics nearby and they still took out a big chunk of my pay. Today
I know you were only a little late but be careful about that if it gets
reported then they can take from your pay." Jessica said.

"How much?" Whiskey asked.

"Like 5% for any lates. I mean Skye probably won't report it at least
immediately." Jessica said.

"Why would she ever even report it?" Whiskey asked.

"She can be a bit of a jobsworthy." Jessica said with a shrug. "She's
lovely but she can get judgy."

"That's good to know." Whiskey said.

"They can send you to other branches too. I used to get sent into the
Reading one a lot the one near the train line. They pay for any travel
expenses or hotels which is nice though but it can be super annoying to
spend so much time travelling. It is nice to see more of the zone
though." Jessica said.

"How often were they sending you?" Whiskey asked.

"When I started I think I spent two or three months filling in out
there. There were a few accidents and I had to fill in until they got a
replacement. Still it can be nice there. Reading is more like in town,
there's a nice bit near the train depot where people come through. Some
pubs even a nice beer garden that was great summer last year." Jessica
said.

"I've been through there a couple of times too. Going through out west."
Whiskey said.

"How far have you been into the zone?" Jessica asked.

"I went to Bristol, furthest I've gone is Plymouth. That place is still
a bit up in the air." Whiskey said.

"I've always wanted to go to see Plymouth. It's the last frontier."
Jessica said.

"It's an interesting place. The military isn't so involved over there
just because of the logistics involved so it's a little town mostly of
alts in the ruins of the marina. It's a great place to barter and
there's always ships coming in to dock. You can see the black zone too
just across the Tamar. Lighting up the sky in a dozen different colors.
I want to go back." Whiskey said. "Last time was maybe three or four
years ago."

"Alts huh. You know I kinda wondered if the new employee was going to be
an alt." Jessica said out loud.

"How come?" Whiskey asked.

"I heard there'd been layoffs at the Ministry and alts seem to get
filtered into the company. There's Skye already but a couple of people
in Reading too. I guess it seemed like I was the only person who was not
an alt who got hired right now." Jessica said.

"Well at training there were a few norm- normal people." Tripping over
her words not to say normies. "It was fairly even though I guess it
means we're disproportionately common in this company."

They arrived back at that street without Whiskey even realizing the
journey.

"Hey so there's a place to get cheap booze just near here if you want to
go and get some." Jessica said.

Whiskey could not turn down a drink. "That sounds good. Though I don't
have a whole lot of money." She said counting out the bills she had in
the back of her mind.

"You can pay me back later." Jessica said.

"I have enough for a round or two I suppose anyway." Whiskey said.

There were no street lights anymore save for the light of a sign which
she assumed was the destination. The sign read KEC from a KFC sign
repurposed and illuminated with flood lights that had been left behind
or pilfered from a checkpoint. The meaning of the letters came into view
as they reached the threshold. Kingly Ealing Cans. It lived up to the
reputation.

"Jess back in the house." The man behind the counter said. "We've got
some new good stuff in today. We got army cocktails, some other canned
cocktails, the sparks mojito is pretty good, we've got some army beer,
other beer." He waved in the direction of some pallets and some
refrigerators that were miraculously on. It was all cans as if the store
owner had declared war against the concept of a glass bottle.

"Do you have anything in the cooler?" Jessica asked.

"We have some army beer and some cocktails, there's the lemony one, as
always." He said with a knowing look.

"I'll go for that then." Jessica said.

He nodded "And for you new blood." Facing towards Whiskey.

"You have any ale, any amber ale or anything?" Whiskey asked.

"Let's see." He looked up into the air as he itemized the stock in the
back of his mind. "We might." He rooted around in the shelves behind him
reading the cans. It was a navy and blue can. Room temperature set on
the counter. He then stooped down and took out two tall cans of yellow
lemon canned premade cocktail with cooled condensation as they were set
down at the counter. "That'll be a fiver." He said naming the price. Of
course, there was a register but the calculator on it sat dormant.

She placed a fiver on the counter and the goods were exchanged. Soon
they were heading back in the direction of the two newly renovated
houses.

"That's a good shop. Thanks for telling me." Whiskey said with a smile.

"It is nice isn't it." Jessica paused. "Still amber ale? I couldn't
drink anything like that."

"Well, it's simple I like beer with flavor. Something nice and
comforting." Whiskey said holding the can carefully.

"I tried that army beer once. It's okay." Jessica said.

"It's fizzy water. It's awful, it's got nothing no flavor." Whiskey said
with a smug smile.

"I've been drinking mixed drinks ever since I started drinking." Jessica
said. "The first time at a house party with some of the other kids at my
school. Vodka mixed with orange juice, or with cola. The only thing a
group of fourteen-year-olds could think of."

"Well I guess you went to more of a party school then." Whiskey said.

"There were only about forty people in my year. I was in a military
school, my dad was in the army so." Jessica said.

Whiskey looked out for a minute. "I wasn't cool enough to get invited to
parties till I was a little older. I never really. Well. Anyway."
Whiskey cut herself off. "Did you live on base or anything?"

"We did. It was a school attached to the base so." Jessica replied.

The conversation sat there in a lull for a minute.

"I made most of my friends back then. I still talk to them. They think
about coming to visit me but there's all the paperwork with coming down
here and it is safe but they think it's not that safe. I should go back
and see them at some point, but we're always texting."

Whiskey flinched a little. Bubbling at the back of her throat there was
something burning something trying to burn its way past her lips. A
searing building pain. The acrid taste of molten metal as she tried to
recast her heart. "That's nice."

"I remember the first time I tried gin with them. It was so gross we
threw up from the taste and not the booze. We did so much stupid stuff
in school. There was the pass out challenge, you'd try and do a bunch of
stuff and stand up super-fast so that you'd pass out. Anyway, this one
girl I knew had a seizure from it." Jessica said smiling about it.

"I see." Whiskey said. "I guess that sounds fun."

They turned a corner at they were back at their little enclave. Whiskey
stayed back a bit while Jessica fiddled with her key. She stood
awkwardly on the threshold not sure if Jessica really meant for her to
follow. Jessica looked back and nodded towards the door inviting her in.

Whiskey was first hit with the smell. The smell of someone else's home,
something that went amiss in a clean room or in the place you actually
lived. It was not particularly pleasant and the room was not quite to
the level of a hoarder but it was more encumbered than one would expect
from a room. Filled with scavenged objects of a lost world. There was a
sofa, a nice kitchen, though with washing up still in the sink
haphazardly. Whiskey took a seat on the sofa which looked clean enough.
She opened her beer, room temperature and started to whisk the night
away with drinking and listening to Jessica talk about relationships.
She was there as an ear to listen deliberately so. Killing every urge
that bubbled up to compel her to speak or intervene. It would do more
harm than good she told herself. All night long she told herself.
Imbibing the alcohol, imbibing the words of a once stranger and now
tentative friend to distract from the rumbles of her mind. The
short-circuiting wires, the blown fuses, now put at rest by the words
and the chemicals diffusing through her ears through her blood. It was
all she could want. A follow up drink took the form of a bottle of
fireball. An old friend of hers. It was half drunk, and decidedly room
temperature. As she took it into her mind it ran against the strobing
fuses.

She wanted to scream, to call out to the world and let the energy
dissipate somewhere. The current surging through her nerves compelling
the formation of tears. She tried to keep it contained to resist it to
try and focus on the saccharine sweetness of the booze such that the
sensation could resist the current. Jessica looked at her with a gaze
that Whiskey did not fully understand for a moment. A look in her eyes.
A genuine concern. Finally, the resistors came into effect. She was
pathetic crying like this over nothing for no reason in front of someone
else. What was she doing being here. She was iron she was steel. Tears
still melted through.

"Are you alright?" Came the question down as a hammer blow. She had been
seen. How much would she pay for this concern. Her mind scrambled to see
the drop in estimation she would experience for acting so pathetically.

"I'm fine." She spoke holding back the shaking burning crying compulsion
trying to wring the tears from her.

"I see." Jessica gave a reserved utterance. Acknowledging the distance
not knowing how to bridge it. "Do you want a smoke?"

"Please." Whiskey looked up. "I'll make it up to you. I'll give you one
of mine. I'll buy you a pack." Said like begging for someone to stop
hitting her. Words that had been seared into her.

"It's okay." Jessica said not wholly sympathetically but not wholly
neutrally.

They stepped outside the door. Jessica lit up her own cigarette and then
looked over to Whiskey. She took her first and deepest breath. The
nicotine and numerous other chemicals making their way from the
cigarette through the filter through her mouth and into her lungs before
spreading into the blood and brain. Interfering with all the signals of
pain. A moment of respite. She would smoke two cigarettes in silence
before making her goodbyes and heading home.

# Chapter 5: Homeostasis

The calendar rolled over onto the next day and she got dressed. Cleared
the sweat off of her face, washed the dried vomit out of her hair.
Stifled the body's cries to vomit. She quickly cleaned off the dried
vomit from the side of the bed. Clearly she had thrown up in her sleep.
Something which may have had lethal consequences had she been unlucky.
For now at least she had luck on her side. She tried not to think about
it. The sting in her nostrils warning her. The faint taste of cinnamon
at the back of her throat. It felt like her body was trying to shake her
consciousness from it. Ridding it of further damage inflicted by the
mind held atop that gnarled spine. The artefact in the base of her neck
seemed to fizz as if to reject the fanciful notion of an aching stomach.
Time to get up and get out.

She looked presentable enough as she stumbled out the door. She doubled
back to lock the door again. She stumbled a half-remembered route. Her
feet remembering more than her half functioning mind. She walked towards
the branch to find that she was embarrassingly early. There was not a
single soul in occupation. She stood outside waiting awkwardly. Trying
to cover up the urge to vomit on her workplace.

After about twenty minutes Skye appeared around the corner.
