Chapter 1 - I have the body

I am breathing. I am alive. There is so much light. There is a body. I can’t move it. It’s not mine. It’s not mine. I don’t remember it. I am not breathing. What is this. A field of churned mud in front of me. What is this. The fire in my ears. I can’t feel the heat. My eyes don’t burn. My lungs don’t burn. I can’t feel the smoke. I can’t feel the air in my lungs. I can’t feel anything. Even trying to feel anything. The feelings they get pushed out of my mind. I can’t even maintain. I can’t even maintain the fear long enough to scream. A cold sedation fills my mind. I am living. I am not alive. 

The screen flashes again. No. The image flashes into my mind. Combat footage. It’s unlike anything I can ever remember. There aren’t green men armed with rifles. There are remote turrets, canons firing, fibre optic drones dancing across the sky. There is still the twisted metal of broken machines. There is still the fire and the smoke. With no mouths left to scream, with no fear left to feel, with no nerves to feel the heat. Even this body isn’t mine. The movements aren’t mine. I’m not in a body. I’m having the memory imposed on my brain. I can’t even look away. It’s everywhere. There are no eyes to close.
It smells. It smells good. Looking at it, paying attention it felt good. Like a warm summer day on my skin. I can’t even look away. I don’t want to. Brain synapses given an incentive surging with activity. Then weapons, commands, listed in front of me. I didn’t know who I was fighting for, what I was fighting for. All I knew was I wanted to fight for it. A plasma pistol, a plasma blade, a light mech, a heavy turret, a drone. I couldn’t look away. Then they forced me to imagine myself in battle. The speed. The warnings. It kept on shouting at me. Overspeed. Overspeed. Overspeed. I started to move sluggish. My imagined metal body not floating in the air like it did. I kept on pressing the throttle further. 

I was a missile. I was a shell. I was the canon. I was the propellant. I was the gunpowder. I was the shell casing. 

Then parts of me tore apart. The simulation broke down as the control services twisted and bent at my own will. Then shutting down. Starting again. I had to dodge. Dodge canons. Dodge rockets. Dodge missiles. The centimetres increased between me and the shells. Five centimetres was all it was. Life and death. Success and failure. One delay, one misstep away. Every second, every microsecond, every micrometre. No margin. The images faded away into a dark sticky ooze that clung to my consciousness. Obliviated into a managed sleeping pattern. 

This was my body. I could feel it now. This was my steel. This was me. It was around me. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t move. That’s okay I’m fine. I’m fine like this. I could see the inside of the transport. I could hear it rattling. The engines roaring and surging. I could smell something good, something far away. I wanted go chasing it. I was an animal. Caged and given the smell of meat far away. An animal with no flesh craving what it can never have. Was there anyone else made of flesh and blood here? 

A map of the battlefield flashed up. It was a blue hologram and accented by red patterns, the enemy, and blue dots, us. There were blue lines which were our lines, and then a dead zone in between. A dead zone that I was being pushed into. I didn’t feel scared. I wanted to get to work. To just get it over with. Fear didn’t even factor into the calculations. Why would it? I was going to have fun down there. 

“Unit W4153 report?” 

I could hear it everywhere. It was the kind of loud that made your ears hurt, made your chest thump feeling the sound waves bounce off you. There was nothing left to bounce off of. There was only the sound. To a degree I couldn’t ignore it. 

“Unit W4153 acknowledged.” 

That was my name now. My designation. W4153. I wonder how high the numbers climb. If they make the strings random and meaningless on purpose. I imagined A1111, how that guy must’ve felt hearing them read that one off. He was smiling, blonde, blue eyes. Of course he wasn’t, he didn’t have hair, or eyes anymore. Maybe he did once. He was one of those guys all the way back in school. Cocky and surrounded by friends. He wasn’t like me. I would never be like him. I have a four, a thirteen, which adds up to four as well. Death, bad luck. A life that was charted by the stars to end in tragedy. Charted by some random number generator. It wasn’t over yet. 

“Confirm activation handoff.”

Great metal mechanisms started to creak into life. 

A voice crackled into mind, less loud than before. 

“Calling all troops of the 4th company, 4th brigade, 4th Mobile Infantry division, your mission is to assault the enemy base on the hill. Expect resistance. Good luck and may God bless your souls. God bless Atlantica.” 

That many 4s had to be bad news. Still fear wasn’t an emotion capable of being felt anymore. The voice sounded more like a person, but it was hard to be sure. If it was a real vibrating larynx or just a dismembered regeneration of one. It was easier to believe in a God than it was to believe totally and completely that one’s commanding officer was a real flesh and blood human. 

The plan started to flash now. In front of their eyes. Generated by machines of loving grace to direct to the objective. It was a command bunker sat atop a hill, surrounded by turrets and three lines of defenses, canons and dumb fire rocket turrets. All controlled by a web of fiber optic cables that also connected to the drones that were constantly circling overhead waiting to pounce down. Some of them already looked like they were moving to intercept the transports. They were to undertake a frontal assault. In more honest words, a suicidal assault on a fortified position. Because it was suicidal there weren’t that many allies that could be noticed.

The transport started to descend. I could monitor it on the map. Right next to the other designations A5679, N7512, P4691, nothing interesting, oh except C8448, that’s a keeper. Let’s see which wins out the 8s or the 4s. It wasn’t long now. The smell was getting stronger. Smelling without a nose was a funny thought. The engine spooled down.

There was a flash. Something was wrong. The transport. The force of it. I was on my back. There was metal twisted all around me. This would not be my coffin. Not this halfhearted attempt to bind me to the mud. The first time I had moved in years. I willed the metal body into life. Not doing so would mean an end to that life. An end to it all. I couldn’t. It wouldn’t be like that. 

The warnings filled my mind with so much sound. There was nothing else except the cries of evade. Missile. Missile. The RWR working overtime to scare me into action. I didn’t care about the speed. I didn’t care about anything. The momentum tore me free. Fast so fast. So much faster. Jumping. High now, into the air. The drones descending into my would-be coffin, meters away. A margin of meters of survival. Whole seconds. This was sloppy workmanship. It would take more than that to kill me. I pushed forward. Now a volley of rockets dumb fire and easy to evade. The lock warnings were drowned out again by overspeed. I spooled it back slightly finding the sweet spot between too fast to lock and too fast to control. Living felt good. Surviving felt good. It was just a bit further now. It smelled so good. 

Just a little more. Just a little further. I felt my own firing computer find a solution to start firing back. I was in range. They couldn’t hit me. My finger pulled the trigger, not once but many, many times. The plasma shooting forward. Bright colors marked the first holes punched in their defensive line. 
Missile, missile. It felt like my heart was spooling up. I had no heart. Something was pulsing through me. They were coming for me. I pushed further the speed but the overspeed warning it wouldn’t. They couldn’t. I couldn’t even make sense of the words now. Like salt that couldn’t break the surface tension. There was only me. This machine. Speed wouldn’t save me now. Run. Run. Run. Live. Live. Live. Please let me live. Please, just leave me alone. I don’t want to. I don’t want to go back. The words started to dissolve into my mind. Chaff, flare. I didn’t even know what to think but there was the sound of something behind me. Then the warnings stopped. Confused by the flares and chaff. I hurtled back towards the ground. It was safer. It was safer I thought. Safer to be closer to the ground. I was so close now. Just a little more. 

I tumbled into the first line of defenses. Cut. Shoot. Lock. Dodge. Tired. Cut. Shoot. Lock. Dodge. I hit the power. The guns they went silent at least for the next few meters. Enough to make the radar warning receiver quiet. It was time to take a breather. Fatigue creeping in, then substituted by drugs. Time to get back to it. No rest for the wicked. Though, smashing through this line. It felt good. The smell far off was getting a little stronger. It was time to go in for the kill. The engines that had spooled back surged back into life. 

The smell was getting stronger. The centimeters between their missiles, their shells and my frame grew longer and longer. You’re going to have to do better than that to earn my hide. I responded with my own shots. It felt good. It felt so good. Breaking through, breaking the back of the second line. It was blown apart. Twisted concrete and tangled cables are all that remains besides. The guns silent again. There was no time for a rest not now. The sky was getting darker as the hill rose underneath me. Silken fiber optic threads dancing above me. Resistant to jamming. Not resistant to blasts from me. It felt so good. Looking behind for a moment the dirt stretched out. There was the trail up the hill. The first trail ever made in a long time. There were twisted metal bones of less successful potential comrades. Potential comrades, one time, long ago maybe. This hill looked down on the city nearby. The mouth of a river and the sea. Maybe there was a path up here once, a good hiking spot. The only path up here was the one he made with his own steel. Paved in twisted barrels, dud shells and rocket shrapnel. 

It was just a little further now. It was like being in pursuit of a meal, the way the smell surrounded me now. I was so hungry. Biological imperatives to kill. A beast doesn’t make paths. A beast doesn’t try to right the wrongs left behind. There is only one road open to such a beast. It was above. It was to follow the smell of the prey. The darkened sky. 

The last line of defenses were light. There was little left to do. Drones couldn’t reach back here enough. This defensive fortification had extracted all the resources it could, there was little more to be gained. I reached into the sky. I gripped the cables and tore them apart. Immediate pleasure filling every single nodule in my brain. Ripping. Ripping. Ripping. The sky now shone out all the clearer. I couldn’t feel the sun’s warmth. Not anymore. That didn’t matter. I felt so good all the same. With the drones cut friendly forces could advance, but that left the defenses. There was a chorus of artillery still firing behind the bunker, rendering death kilometers away. 

The concrete was easy to break, it felt so good. The rubble fell apart. The marks in it were jagged, not made by a human, not made by a machine, they were made by an animal. Desperate and without pattern except the pattern of random motions that marked a predator gorging itself on still warm meat. The core was covered by the collapse. The feeling was intense. A mind that was now so immersed in happy chemicals that rational thought would not be able to continue. Washed away in bliss. The one who conquered the hill standing there idle hands still buried inside the rubble. 
 
Chapter 2 - Silicone Welcome

It was bright. Brighter than anything. Consciousness bursting through frayed wires. It was a kitchy mmo, asset flipped into a reality. Screaming. He was screaming. He was trying to scream. Vocal cords that weren't there. Screaming into text chat the same abyssal single word. The same sounds strung together, wrung out of sound, turned to representations, and reprocessed into lines in the bottom left of a hud. 

C5681: "We got a new one!" 

W4153: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA."

T4129: "He's going to take a minute to scream himself out."

C5681: "You weren't any better." 

T4129: "It's an adjustment."

W4153: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA."

C5681: "The quiet ones are scarier, I never could trust them."

T4129: "Holy shit."

C5681: "What?"

T4129: "This guy, he's the continental front, that crazy fucking kid who took down a whole line."

W4153: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA."

C5681: "No shit. He's the guy?"

T4129: "Yeah, from the dare to die battalion. The old models."

W4153: "AAAAAAAAAAA."

C5681: "One of Clark's guys huh. Never thought I'd see that."

T4129: "Garbage in garbage out." 

W4153: "AAAAAA."

C5681: "Exactly. I guess they found the diamond in the rough."

T4129: "He got lucky, charging into defenses like that."

C5681: "We all have luck when we're out there. It's how we use the luck we're given."

W4153: "AAAA." 

T4129: "Luck can only take you so far." 

C5681: "If it takes you to the next day, that's enough."

W4153: "WHERE AM I WHERE AM I WHERE AM I WHERE AM I WHAT IS THIS WHERE AM I."

C5681: "You're in the recreation room." 

T4129: "This is where you go after a mission's finished, some consciousness on a server somewhere."

W4153: "WHAT IS THIS WHAT IS THIS."

C5681: "Shit, Bowler, we're not getting through to him."

T4129: "He'll come to. Just give him a minute."

W4153: "WHO AM I WHO AM I."

C5681: "This is an MMO, an old copy of one. You know I think I used to play this. All that time ago."

T4129: "You were such a nerd."

W4153:

C5681: "It was good back then sticking around in your room all day. Couldn't last though."

T4129: "Some of us had to work."

W4153: 

C5681: "Only the dumb ones." 

T4129: "Whatever man."

W4153: "Hello."

Two shapes. Humanoid. Perfect lines. Similar slider mediated dimensions. The same art assets, the final directions of a long dead developer. Face picked from a handful of options. On the left with the numbers C5681 hanging above in blue text, he had brown hair. A boyish heroic hairstyle. Some stubble. Next to him stood T4129, black of hair, blue of eyes. Clean shaven. Heroic also. These were the faces designed for heroes. Expression muted but present. Brains filtered through lines of fiber running up the spinal coloumn. A communion of meat and metal, glass and fat, running into muscle, into brain, into chips, into copper. Velveted copper. 

C5681: "Welcome man. I'm Potomac, and this is."

His body played out a gesturing animation.

T4219: "I'm Lawrence." 

C5681: "And we're here to welcome you to the recreation room."

W4153: "I was out there. I was. I was made of. I wasn't." 

C5681: "Relax soldier. It's okay in here. There's a million things coming to get you but none of them can reach you out here." 

T4129: "I'm not sure you should be telling them that."

C5681: "He'll be fine, brain full of shells and ashes, this shit is weird after all that. Gotta give him a reference point." 

T4219: "Wait is he a he?" 

C5681: "Sorry soldier, what are you? Private, Major, Dog, Cat, Boy, Girl, Precocious teenager?" 

T4219: "You really need to drop precocious teenager from that."

W4153: "I don't. I don't know." 

He looked down and saw a grey arm reaching out. A grey featureless body wiped clean of any distinct features. Average height, average build.

W4153: "Help. Help. Help. Help." 

C5681: "The character creator you can find that in your hud. You should spawn with a ticket. Find that and then touch use and then." 

W4153: "What."

T4219: "You need to bring up your inventory. It's bottom right, these little grey circles assembled into rectangles. Click on the leftmost of those rectangles, it should bring up another menu and in the top left you should have this ticket looking thing."

C5681: "Actually it looks more like a railway track, but filled in and beige."

T4219: "So, it looks like a ticket."

W4153: "Okay. Right."

Then W4153 was somewhere else.
