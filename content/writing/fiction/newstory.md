# Chapter 1

The day was bright and cold. The building was insulated enough even
though some windows had been perforated. The monster that had cut those
lacerations had long receded, contained beyond fences and soldiers. Out
to the west. In the zone. It was a Sunday. The time was nearing 9am and
the sun continued to climb impeded by cloud or the worries of mortals
that lay underneath its outstretched bounds. Inside the room there lay a
mattress. The sink worked somehow, having been patched many times. There
were other mattresses below, and they all stood unoccupied save the one
on this, top floor. Next to the sink there was a bottle of whiskey it
had been drained three quarters and a sticky shot glass next to it. On
the floor below there were bottles in various states of drainage, the
glasses were still sticky but the hands that had held them had long
since moved on. In the ruined townhouse there remained only one soul.

On her arm a scar ran down, it was thin and jagged. She could still
recall the pain when she had to remove part of her own skin. She still
carried the knife with her. She told herself it was intended to be used
in the same manner if she had to do the same procedure again. She looked
in the mirror and saw her face through the lens of a headache. Her bones
creaked her muscles pulled taught as strings and ached for the exertion.
She took out her black notepad to look over the details again. She was
after all meeting with a client later today at Scotland Yard. She had
her ID laid out nicely to get through the cordon and into Whitehall.
Most people would have a name on their ID, a date of birth, and then
other functional information, expiration date and issuance date and
type. She had a designation, W8194-HB. She did not have a date of birth,
instead, d.o.c. which stood for date of contact, 08/03/2019. The gender
was listed as M bracketed. The specter of legal malehood still asserted
even as any claim to humanity was revoked. As if the final passing shot
removing herself from her own identity. The bracketing was supposed to
denote previous gender before being turned into a mutant but it was
taken to mean the only valid means of identification.

Thinking about the ID itself kicked up the mental sediment at the back
of her brain, and gazing over at the glass of booze she needed to settle
it back down. She took the bison grass vodka and poured a shot before
downing it. It burned. For a moment she felt guilt. There was no-one
here to judge her for drinking in the morning anymore, except her
reservations. Which burnt away. All her thoughts and anxieties on this
morning dissolved within the alcohol forming a solution of happiness
that soothed her mind. She let out a sigh. Her clothes were still in her
green military backpack. There was a unit patch front and center, An
outline of the county of Cornwall with a target and skull overhead, and
a lightning bolt. She had at one point been a redeemer after all. There
was also another one, it had been custom sown and the lines were a
little amateurish, more so than the other. A tuxedo kitten with the
words lethal kitten written over it. Then there was just a British flag,
kept obscured behind the pouch was one other that she kept rather more
hidden.

There had been other patches and backpacks in this place once. She
looked at herself in the mirror. Her mind was still looking into the
fading shadows of what once was and no longer could ever be. Her mind
grasping out for reassurance, gasping. As the thoughts drew a trail of
tears. She had been through it all she told herself. She had always
remained. Like steel. Like cold hard steel. She looked into the mirror
and would be strong. She took a shot of vodka to cast her psyche into
that steel. That was the narrative she spun to defend her habit.

She took out her clothes. A black long sleeved thermal vest and DPM
camouflage trousers as well as a pair of cotton thick navy-blue socks.
She pulled over the heavy-set walking boots and set about tying them up.
Then she was off under the sun's bright and cool gaze. The city of
London too had been hollowed out, as the grand townhouses and
real-estate values had been drained white. It was a decaying giant.
Limbs occasionally jerked in the throes of rigor mortis. The government
trying to resuscitate the decaying urban core. Perhaps one day they
would devise some technique to turn the random jerking into something
more coherent. Time would one day tell. The city would continue to decay
until such day. It was one of these government offices in the center she
was headed towards. Past the open-air markets of Hyde Park, past the
last military garrison in the Guards tower, one of the few skyscrapers
that still stood tall. Whitehall and Parliament itself had been walled
off. It was more of a compound occupied by the government that ruled now
from Edinburgh. Still whatever operations they tried to continue in the
old capital would be done in the most sterile of settings. The buildings
had sustained less damage here and at one point it had served as
makeshift hospital and residential area before everyone was cleared out.
Those were the days, where things were supposed to go back to how they
once were. Before calcifying in place as the reconstruction money ran
out. As the people of London, the people of Southern England bled across
Europe, leaving this corpse. One day perhaps they would be transfused
back.

The walls and fences around Whitehall would come down. Guns would once
more be made illegal and the monarch would return to Buckingham palace.
She remembered those long dead days. The normal that had been so
unassailable reduced to the ruins she walked past. She reached the gate.
The guard on duty was not military. The last remains of the Peelers of
all. Not that there was much civil administration south of Cambridge
anymore, yet in places it still tried to live. The paperwork was easy
enough. The benefit of being a Mutant, or as ever so affectionately
known, a mutie, you had one of these ID cards. A double-edged sword
perhaps. Having your name be registered so neatly might make you all the
easier to find. For right now it served a certain utility. The next was
the appointment letter all neatly laid out. He did not need to know it
was a photocopy and not the technically correct watermarked copy. She
was waved through.

The meeting was in Scotland Yard, the artefact investigations unit. Her
employers now that her prior self-employment with her friends had fallen
through. This new arrangement would have to suffice. The receptionist
lived within the compound. A cushy job as a receptionist in a walled off
compound wearing nice clean clothes and makeup. A tinge of envy was
palpable. The receptionist looked up and noticed the interloper. Not
even a regular visitor, a police officer, someone who was naturally
supposed to be there. And upon the interloper's head there were more
intrusions into the receptionist's own sense of normality as her eyes
scanned over the figure before them. There were two cat ears, and a tail
behind her. It was not uncommon for someone who had been to the zone to
come back different mentally or physically. Even if someone in the city
had heard of such things it did not temper their reaction upon first
contact. It was a stare that was the mark of the interloper, she knew it
so well, as the memory of a thousand such stares pierced into her.

Yet none of those memories could pierce her. She was steel. Cast through
fire and flame and a shot of vodka. It would not pierce her. It could
not. After all, even if her gaze did pierce there was nowhere for the
shell to go that could cause any damage. For all that there was beneath
that armor that could be harmed had been destroyed to the point that it
could receive no further damage. There was nothing left to burn.

Once the stare had passed, she put her meeting letter on the desk with
her ID card, to get the formalities out the way. The receptionist
snapped out by the gestures of normality got to work tapping away at her
computer. She reads out the letter and the number as if it is a name.
For her purposes it is a name. A neat way of filing an interloper as
something thoroughly separate. The meeting room would be the same, the
artefact investigation department, basement floor one. The underworld as
it was known.

"Here you go, miss- sir." A passing shot. Even with her long hair, short
stature, and other bodily features that clearly made her a woman, if it
was not written in a way that she was capable of understanding
bureaucratically then it did not matter. Nothing mattered other than
that card. Not here in the center of the last vestige of civil
administration in this former capital.

The appointment would be with DI Clark K. Mortzavi, the ostensive
handler. Every so often she would go to him to receive her marching
orders. Usually, a grisly murder of a police officer attempting to
assert control beyond Whitehall, but it was also other interested
parties. The met was not above being hired as a tool between rival
artefact dealers and if in the end it made for nice reports for the
suits in Edinburgh then all the better really. So long as the bribe was
left absent or couched in formal language about reports from members of
the public. The nominal authority and nominal laws could still be quite
the potent tool. North of London their authority was less nominal and
more simply normal so it really was quite the potent tool. She was
thinking idle in the waiting room sitting pretty on a metal folding
chair. The door opened and a couple of other muties stumbled out. This
one had a lizard tail, you do not see that often. The other a wagging
dog tail which was far more common, Pluto was her name, they had a
history with DI Clark both sharing the same handler. Pluto was Hispanic
which was uncommon and led to her being treated as even more of an
interloper than otherwise.

"Hey Whiskey." The dog tail struck up conversation. It was not the case
that every mutie knew each other, far from it. However, in the same
workplace and situation one does build a certain familiarity.

Whiskey returned with a nod before looking over at the lizard tail, who
was unfamiliar. "Hey Pluto, who's she? Someone I know?" Pluto gave a
scowl. It was her name but not a name she liked to be called by. Whiskey
knew but they went back long enough that the inertia made her unwilling
to change.

"You still haven't kicked your habit, you alcoholic whore. Are you still
running with the team you had been before? Or did they all run off on
you?" Pluto said tinging the final syllable with an upward inflection
designed to draw as much blood as possible.

Whiskey just gave her a smile. "I'm glad you're doing ever so well." She
said simply.

"Whatever. Enjoy Clark." Pluto gave a wave and started walking through
the exit.

The accompanying lizard tailed girl looked over at Whiskey for a moment
before seeing Pluto's exit and so she started shuffling after her. What
a strange grouping she thought. The door remained closed a little
longer. She took a second to look it up and down, a wooden or perhaps
fake wooden door. Instead of a name plaque there was a name sticker as
if made in a label maker. It was slightly lopsided.

The door clicked and swung open. Clark was not a thin man though it was
hard to tell how much of that was on account of his baggy suit. He had
tired dark eyes and a short beard. He held the door frame and poked his
head out in Whiskey's direction.

"Hey Whiskey, you're up." He said.

Her movements were sluggish as she left the chair behind and stumbled
over to Clark.

"Woah, what's going on with you here?" He looked over. "Have you been
drinking?"

"So what?" Giving the best defense she could.

"Look whatever, I know you've been having it rough recently but." He
gave a pause trying to tabulate the best words to say without touching a
nerve.

"I don't care. What are you going to tell me, that drinking is bad, that
I'm going to an early grave? Who cares. I'm already some mutated freak,
and all I can do is wet work like this or rot in bed. Nobody is coming
for me. Nobody cares about me. So why the hell does it matter anyway?
I'm good, I can get what I have to do done, and you're standing there
pretty, you don't have to live in a shack surrounded by the junk they
all left behind." She didn't shout. Her words were a harsh and firm
salvo but she maintained composure as she said her truth. "So yeah, I
guess I am having a rough time, but I'll get through it. That's what
they always said. Even if I'm the junk scrap steel that they all left
behind."

Clark let out a long sigh. "Okay whatever, just, get in here. You're not
that drunk anyway. You have your notebook? Right?" He looked over at
her.

She tapped her pocket and it was there, a notebook that was still crusty
from being wet and dried out but the pages were still in good enough
state to be read and to take a pencil. Next to it in the pocket was a
single HB pencil, wooden with no eraser and she probably had a sharpener
in her backpack.

"So, what's the mission boss?" Whiskey said with a smirk.

"Right straight to business then." Clark paused before launching into
it.

"Wait, actually I have a question, who was it with there with Pluto back
there?"

"You've not met Oak yet? She's quiet, she's a more recent encounter
actually, just a few months ago, yeah, she's pretty good. She's
absolutely a better fit with Pluto. You weren't good at dealing with
that pup, she likes the sound of her own voice and she's not worth
disagreeing with, even though you would constantly. She still blames you
for what happened with Edwin; you know, I mean I can understand why."
Clark was about to keep on speaking before he was interrupted.

"Can we not?" Whiskey let out with a sigh. The room was stuck in silence
for a moment. "What about this job you have for me?"

A little taken aback by the interruption Clark started to get back on
track. "Well. Where to start even. The Americans are coming here,
specifically the Vice President and the Secretary of State." Clark
looked over to see Whiskey about to start writing. "I'd prefer that this
information stay in the room with us here."

"Well can't I just write VIP? Maybe I could downgrade the country or the
position? Anyway, why are they coming here and not Edinburgh? Or at
least why aren't they sticking to the bases in Cambridge?" Whiskey
asked.

"It's more that they've got tired of the lax approach down here. I mean
I can speculate but I can't know, I might someone who lives over here
with all the comings and goings. This stuff is above my paygrade, and
way above your clearance level. So, hell even if I did know I wouldn't
be telling you. As much as I love and appreciate you and your work, you
mangy old cat." He paused for a second. "Anyway look, if you have to
have me tell you what I think is going on, it's that they're tired of
dealing with London's shit. We're pretty close to Cambridge, where all
of their expensive shit is and we're left as this rotting urban center
full of crime, full of crazy druggies, alcoholics." He paused for a
second and then gave her a grin. "No offence to you."

"None taken." Whiskey replied with a smile. "I guess it's about regional
stability then, so do they want a more active role? What about you? This
office?"

"Look I haven't heard anything just yet but there are rumors,
murmurings, I guess. Less about a whole takeover but more oversight,
they'll be sending some of their guys here, starting to expand offices
and set up more regular patrols. Bringing back normality, restoring
order. That's what I heard anyway. I don't imagine things will change
that much down here, other than perhaps bribes losing their
effectiveness we'll have to see." Clark let out a sigh.

"Do you actually believe them? I mean they've been saying that for years
haven't they? About the bribes I mean." Whiskey said with a jumbled tone
as her thoughts meandered into speech.

"Well that's the question isn't it. You know, you've met some of their
guys and I've met some of their guys and believe it more this time.
Before it was some guy who'd just come down four, five hours from
Edinburgh with a white paper, a nice suit, and a dream and a briefcase
and not a single solitary cheque. Those guys though, they mean
business." He said with a kind of uncertain confidence.

He was not wrong though. Those guys did mean business. She had fought
along side them pushing the zone back from Portsmouth. The screaming of
F-35As overhead, the sound of its engines rumbling in her chest followed
by the roar of the jdams falling on the line beasts ahead. When they
wanted to get something done those guys did mean business.

"I guess you're right." She said.

"You did serve with them so I guess that makes me feel a little more
confident in my own prediction. I guess what would change down here is
that there might be fewer things for us to be dealing with." Clark said
upbeat.

"That is not great for me. I'm not salaried like you." Whiskey said with
a bit of concern.

"Well, there's a cat café somewhere just outside the Green zone in Soho,
I think you'd fit in there just fine. Besides it wouldn't kill you to do
something a little safer." He said with a smirk, but his eyes showed a
kind of hope.

"Wow. Well, whatever we got off topic. The job you have for me. I need
more booze money after all." She said trying to play it off and avert
the tone.

"You see that's why briefings with you are always a pain, we end up
going way off topic, with Pluto and Oak, I sit her down, explain the
mission, let her bitch about this that and the other for a minute, shake
her hand and send her on her way. You, you find some way to make me talk
about some other bullshit and here we are 15 minutes behind schedule."
With a pretend annoyed tone.

"We have fun." Whiskey said with a smirk.

"Right, business actually this time." Clark collected his papers for a
moment to refresh his memory after the distraction. "So, we're having
this VP, well VIP, two of them they're landing at Heathrow, now Heathrow
is mostly secure nowadays but what we're not sure about is London City,
that airport should be out of commission but we haven't got anything up
to date on it, is the runway still usable? Because if it is it could
lead to serious airspace threats. So we want you to have a look around,
preferably just to see what's going on down there, give us some up to
date intel and avoid creating too much of a fuss if there's anything
bigger."

"That it? Couldn't you just send a patrol down there?" Whiskey sounded
confused as she spoke and a little annoyed.

"You're cheaper than a patrol." He said with a laugh. "But also less
conspicuous, smarter, more experienced, less corrupt, and you know what
to look for. Besides they don't want to take on the job."

Whiskey's thoughts lingered on the last sentence. "They don't want to
take it? Do we have any intelligence about the situation down there that
leads the Americans to believe there might be a threat waiting in the
wings?"

"That's a bit above your clearance grade." Clark lingered.

"Well? I mean if you're sending me, I'm going to find out anyway. What's
the point in something like that? Or do the guys upstairs in the patrol
rooms know the details and that's why they won't go, they're worried
that if anyone else hears then they're not going to want to go?" Whiskey
asked in not a fully accusatory tone but certainly in an interrogative
one. "I'm fine, I'm going to take this job, I've got nothing better to
be doing, and if you want me to end up in that cat café near Soho and
not six feet under, then I need all the information you have."

Clark let out a sigh. "Look they told me not to say, since they figure
that it's not good intel and the point is to have you scout to see
what's going on, not to get your hands dirty and actually find what
they've heard and what they're worried about." He let out another sigh.
"What they've heard upstairs is that there's a Russian artefact dealer
operating out of the airport."

"So that's where Medvedev ended up. I thought he was still in the yellow
zone around Chelsea." Whiskey said, semi-interrupting.

"Trust you to know." Said Clark.

"He gave pretty good prices, specifically for cheaper artefacts too,
usually beast parts, but sometimes he put in for just the pretty stuff,
none of the actual useful expensive stuff, he was good to work for."
Whiskey said. "I mean he's probably a Russian asset but."

"He is a Russian asset. We know that one for certain. Well, they know
upstairs, it's in the report right here. That you aren't cleared to
read." Clark sighed, as more information tumbled out of his mouth.
"You'd make a really good spy you know."

"I think you just like talking to me specifically, I'm not sure it'd
work with other people." Whiskey said with a long sigh.

"Anyway, we had intelligence that he was using the airport as his
compound, and we heard that he had imprisoned a beast there himself,
along with a few of his guys. Basically, the Americans don't know but we
are worried about them flying into Heathrow with the possibility of him
and his guys with a runway. They want it cleared out but we're not even
sure if the intelligence is true in the first place, or if its even him
and not just some other guys or if the runway is usable." Clark asked.

"A beast huh, I guess that's why the boys upstairs wanted to leave this
to us, to the pros. I still don't really get it though, even if the
runway is usable its not like they could have a plane take off and be a
threat. Certainly not enough of one to deal with a fighter escort. It's
not like they would've been able to fly in any fighters from Russia. Not
without them or us knowing and probably not without causing an
international incident." Whiskey asked again.

"They need more artefacts for their military and like it or not we're
the only place for that. I'm not entirely sure what they're worried
about either, but my guess is decoys. Decoy drones are pretty big, and
to have the kind of range they need, they'd need to be flying off from
well, a runway. The idea is that they might also have some jets fly from
Russia, have them loiter at long range and then launch the decoys and
then strike, and with all the confusion in the airspace then they could
try and play it off as a mid-air collision, and they'd have the evidence
to back it up. Hell they could just do a mid-air collision anyway. It's
not like we don't have a lot of birds in the air with all of the
rebuilding the Americans are doing." He looked over at Whiskey who still
seemed a bit unconvinced.

"Well, I guess if we're right, if the Americans are bringing things
under control, it's going to be harder for them to smuggle the artefacts
they need out but this just begs the question why fly into Heathrow? Why
not fly into Cambridge where there are no threats and where they have
much more control?" Whiskey asked thinking things over.

"My guess is that they'll call things off if things aren't done, because
they can't drive here, they couldn't fly in if City is like this and if
the Russians want to go out of their way to attack then even flying into
Cambridge isn't necessarily going to be safe." Clark said scratching his
head.

"Why does this even need to happen anyway. It's all just political pomp
after all." Whiskey said incredulously.

"That's the point. I mean for one they don't know if this threat is
genuine, and if it isn't there isn't that much to worry about, a few
small-time thugs and small arms, arms dealers. Even without incentive
they won't have the gear to actually do that much. I think the reason
this has to happen is for us though. It's about saving face. I don't
think the guys in Edinburgh would accept being pushed back without some
gesture from them, and I think from their perspective its easier to do
this than to actually do anything against the boys in Edinburgh,
militarily speaking I mean. So, the strategic calculus makes sense. Also
they don't even know that there's the possibility of them being shot
down because we haven't told them. I mean what kind of country would
even humor us if we have a hostile nation operating on our own
territory." Clark said with a nod.

"I suppose." Replied Whiskey with a sigh. "I'll get going then, I need
my gear after all." She finished noting down the mission. She had her
marching orders.

"I would have you sign the contract but we can't really be frivolous
with the photocopier, for now just sign here, on my notepad. I need a
paper trail so I can pay you. I can't just expense you anymore they're
getting all up my ass on the corruption watch shit." Clark explained.

Whiskey sighed, walked over and took the outstretched pen writing her
signature. "Are we done here?"

Clark gave a nod, and with that she was off.

Now all that would be left was the preparation for the mission. She
shook Clark's hand and then headed for the door. She had some gear lying
around still. A rifle an L1A1 SLR, and a Webley revolver, but she was
running low on ammunition, she would have to go shopping so to speak.
The mission did not seem much trouble. Provided that she could keep to
the mission anyway. Staying undetected if possible, keeping engagement
to a minimum, if possible if detected, and avoiding contact with the
beast, if possible, if detected and if engaged. With a spring in her
step and a clear set of orders she marched for Oxford Street where the
best suppliers would be.

# Chapter 2

Bond Street had once been, had ceased to be, and then been reborn as a
center of commerce once again. The street had finally been
pedestrianized not through an act of the state but through the act of
people congregating to create a large open-air market. There was
anything for sale and there were no officers in sight. People would
offer up a few staples, rats on skewers, if anything London today might
have had fewer rats than before. With a lower population and the
introduction of a hungry populace it made a degree of sense. Though then
again refuse collection was a distant historic memory at this point and
with the various collapsed buildings spread throughout the city there
were plenty of places for rats to breed in relative safety. After all
the rat trade was becoming gradually outcompeted by the return of more
traditional means of nourishment. Existing as both an ultra-budget
option for those still unable to buy and a delicacy for those who had
developed a taste for it. Even with all the bones though the little
bones were precisely why Whiskey did not prefer to eat rat. There were
also squirrel skewers though those were more expensive, the premium
offering as it were.

The rat stalls had lost ground to the return of the sausage roll. The
meat was nondescript but well-seasoned. Perhaps the market might someday
reclaim the greatness of Greggs, they were getting closer. To the point
that Whiskey was tempted drawing closer. The price was reasonable but it
depended on how much she had left over after buying the necessary
materials for her job. The guns were not sold in the open-air section of
the market. Some of the buildings flanking Oxford Street were seemingly
structurally sound enough still for continued business. The weapon
suppliers were in one such building. The Plaza Shopping Centre was an
art deco building that had been spared much damage. It was easily one of
the best retail spaces in the area and as such it is understandable that
it was given to the group most able to take and hold ground. It was also
slightly on the edge of the shopping area which leant it a relative
seclusion and the building itself was more cavern-like than open air. As
such the clientele felt more protected. There was also the fact that the
building was so untouched that gave it a sense of security. It had a
statue still standing over the entrance in the same place it had always
been as though it had been protecting its building. Hand outstretched to
the sky as though to shield the building from beasts or the bombs meant
to blow them apart. There were a few stray bullet holes but those could
have been more recent additions anyway from either extremely satisfied
or dissatisfied customers.

Inside as Whiskey walked in there was an escalator, it was not moving
but she had been told that there were plans of restarting it. It was so
pristine that the stores that once occupied the place were still listed.
She made her way to the first floor and the second store on the right.
When she first came the stores largely ignored the old unit demarcation
but as time went on, they seem to have receded into the old borders. She
pushed the door open into her regular shop, Cherub Dynamics, it had a
cardboard sign just above the door covering up the old branding. It
depicted a small cherub holding an M4 carbine, wearing a helmet with
'born to kill,' and a peace button on it. Whiskey looked up and smiled
at the sign and let out a satisfied sigh. Walking in the shopkeeper
looked up from the rounds he was coaxing into a box and gave Whiskey a
smile. It had been a while since she had crossed that threshold.

"Welcome back, good to see you man." He gestured for Whiskey to come
over. "Man, it's been a while, how's Sasha doing, you keeping her clean?
She's a real good one, I knew from the moment I fixed her barrel she was
going to be a good one." The shop keep spoke quickly but with a real
warmth.

"I'm okay Alex, I'm good. Yeah. I guess it has been a while. Sasha's
doing good, I'm probably going to have to swing back home for her later,
I have a job tonight." Whiskey spoke slowly but maintained the same
warmth.

"Night-crawling then, good job. You haven't been shooting anything
subprime through Sasha? It has really been a while you know, I wouldn't
be surprised if she was a little roughed up with substandard ammo." Alex
said pulling his hands back.

"Well, the group and I after we stopped shopping at yours, we'd go to
this dealer in Chelsea. His rounds shot but having been cleaning the
barrel it does look like it's not doing too great. The receiver looks a
little worn, maybe I'll have to take her in to see you, you fixed her up
the first time you can do it again." Whiskey was not actually sure if
there had been much damage or if the rate of damage was higher than it
should be, but she wanted to have an excuse to come out here again. She
wanted to make an excuse to come back and see him again.

"Oh, right he was that weird Russky guy wasn't he Peter or some such? I
remember him, why'd you stop going down there? His product not up to it?
I mean I wouldn't be surprised, Russkies and all that they're all in it
for the money you know, not the joy of the craft like with me." Alex was
probing a little and had unintentionally dropped a little bit of his
friendliness but more because he was thinking about business now. It
would be easy to think that the love of the craft line was a business
strategy, but having heard Alex go on and on about rifles, calibers and
seeing the length he went to, to refurbish old firearms it seemed he
really did love it.

"I don't really talk to the guys anymore. Going back to his shop didn't
feel right. Well it never really did but they liked his prices and they
seemed to not like you." Whiskey trailed off. Part of it was not wanting
to talk about them anymore, part of it was that she felt guilty. She had
always liked Alex but they thought he was overly friendly and one of
them even called him a creep. Did not like muties like them, there were
so many rumors in the group. Whiskey did not much care for them, she
liked the guy even if he was a bit rough around the edges sometimes.

"I do miss you guys you know. I miss the time when you'd come down here,
and I'd have something to show off to you. Even when I used to take you
down to Soho and we'd shoot." Alex started to go on.

"It's not forever. It never was." She said simply. "We should go
shooting again, once this job is through."

"That'd be real nice if we could. Not like old times though. I guess I
could call in my crew." Alex said.

"I still know some people. Hell I could probably get the detective out
of his basement." She said with a smile.

"Oh is that the famed DI Clark, you guys are always talking about him.
I've always wanted to get to know the guy." Alex said smiling too now.

"He shares my penchant for revolvers. I'm sure if you had something
exotic it would pique his interest." She was smiling, lost in the shadow
of happier times for a moment. He was about to start speaking before she
started up again. "Well that matter aside, I need to get to business."

"Right yeah." He was still smiling but far less animated. "So it was a
recon mission you were doing wasn't it?"

"Yeah, tonight I'm going to London City Airport to go and see the
situation as it were. Ideally I'm going to be able to avoid direct
confrontation but I want to have tools at the ready if things do go for
the worse." She was not smiling as she rattled off the technical
details. "Oh I'm going to need a rope and some bolt cutters too. I lost
mine so if you could. I can afford them and everything, just if you have
some."

"You'll want some more 7.62x51 NATO for Sasha I take it. You still have
magazines for it or need a couple more? Any kind of rounds you're
wanting in specific." He asked.

"Oh that's right." She paused for a second. "Can I ask that the next
thing I say stays between us?" She subconsciously hushed her voice and
moved slightly across the counter towards him.

"Sure man. I don't have any reason to go round telling." He leaned over
the counter as well in a sign of agreement.

"From what I've heard they're holding a beast at the airport." Whiskey
said quietly.

"A beast huh? It's been a while since one of those was in London. Why
held up though?" Alex asked.

Whiskey shrugged. "It's what I've heard, but in light of that I wouldn't
mind a box of incendiary, and a box of FMJ. If you could. Oh and
binoculars, I broke my last pair. And the bolt cutters. And the rope."

Alex nodded as he started walking round back. Whiskey laid her hand on
the counter, tapping her fingers away, looking around the store. He was
back promptly. He was holding in one hand a couple of ammo boxes, and in
the other a canvass bag. Whiskey had assumed it was the other
paraphernalia she needed, but his smile led her to believe it was
something else.

"I forgot, I just got this in, this'd be perfect for you tonight I
mean." He set the boxes on the counter along with the canvass from which
he pulled a strange looking pistol. It was obscure, old and arcane, and
exceedingly rare. It was a Welrod pistol, in strikingly good condition.
It's shots were subsonic and thus made significantly less noise than
other comparable firearms, though at the cost of range. Even more
interestingly was that it shot standard ammo, rather its construction
led to the shots being subsonic when shot. A nifty feat of second world
war engineering.

"Wow." Whiskey said with a smile.

Alex smiled back "Yeah." He said simply.

"There's no way I can take it though. Even if the ammo's relatively
cheap, this belongs in a museum. I probably can't afford it." Whiskey
said scratching the back of her neck.

"Just take it for tonight. We can call it a test. Or a rental. Pay me
back when you get paid." Alex said happily.

"I can't. It's such a good gun it'd be wasted on me." Whiskey said
again. Though this was less of an impassioned rejection and more a
rejection to ensure he was sure about passing on such a relic.

"Just bring it back to me okay?" He said as he pushed it towards her.
"You probably shouldn't be firing this at all until you mean it, to keep
the wipes intact." He started pulling on the bolt. "This is the bolt
action see?" He handed it to her and she went through the motion.

"If you're giving it to me then I'll take it. I'll bring it back to you
though probably not in perfect condition." Whiskey said with a smile and
a sigh.

"That's what I wanted to hear." Alex replied.

Alex went and got the rest of what she needed and she exchanged paper
money with him. They still used the old pre-war bank notes after all.
She gave him a wave and went on her way. On her way out she saw Pluto
and Oak she gave them a nod but it seemed Pluto was still a little
annoyed at her.

She decided to walk her way back to Kensington, to the townhouse which
had been drained of life. She was the sole and remaining inheritor of
the building. Carefully she loaded magazines. Two full metal jacket, two
incendiary. She put on her webbing and put the full metal jacket on her
left and the incendiary on her right. She did not load the rifle
immediately. She packed a torch, the other things she had got from Alex
in her back pack. Along with the Welrod instead of her usual revolver.
Then she rested for a moment.

Once again, the call of the booze came over her. Her memories of the
house when it was full of life. When there were other glasses half full
of liquor. When she drank to make the good times feel better, rather
than to just cleanse herself of any bad thoughts. When there were other
people to cheers with. A burned up past, burnt to ashes, burnt like the
back of her throat as she drank, burning the feelings she had into ash.
Before a mission she needed something to steady her hand. It was going
to be a long walk in the dark and the cold. She needed the warmth to
ward off the cold. Using that rationale, she had one more shot. Now that
she had something to drink, she set about getting something to eat as
well. As a group at one point, they bought ration packs in bulk that
curiously went forgotten. Her alimony payment paid in pre-preserved
penne alla arabiata. It did not taste bad. She poured water into the
retort pouch and listened to it heat and steam. She held the steam in
her face for a moment. It was nice and relaxing. Her ears twitched a
little at the sudden hot air. The food and booze were a welcome
reprieve.

She looked at the newspaper on the floor. It was an issue from a few
months ago. People had started selling papers fairly recently after the
liberation and at first, she was an avid reader. She was not sure when
she stopped wanting to pay attention to the news. The newspapers went
read by other people in the group but she started just going from day to
day. It did not matter to her anymore. She was happy with the people she
had. The state of the containment of the war itself was no longer so
much of a worry of hers. Even having fought in it and worked in its
aftermath it just did not feel like it mattered as much as the touch and
love of the people around her. Even as those people passed out of her
life she did not feel the need to once again find a sense of solace in
the papers. Perhaps she should pick it up again. Something to ease her
mind, more than booze and food.

It had been a few weeks but it was only now that she really set about
going through the scant possessions that had been left strewn in the
rooms that had at one point housed more than just her. A body with its
organs scraped out, yet still remained the collective tissue, veins and
arteries headed to nowhere. The punctuation around the redacted words
giving the shape of absence. She was the only one in this place who
could still remember where everything was supposed to belong. The miasma
of memories growing thicker with every second she remained in this
place. She could see the happier times, she could see the scenes of
happier times. As if she could just reach out and carry on where
everything was left off.

She left the complex behind. It would take two maybe even three hours of
walking to reach the remains of London city airport from Kensington by
foot. Her calves were thick and strong but even she would need to take
breaks on such a long sojourn across the city. She walked through the
ruined city, hearing the symphony of civilization increase in volume
with every step. She was to step through the whole performance. It was
shorter than before. The buildings now monuments to that longer fuller
symphony that had been lost to time. As she passed through Knightsbridge
she saw a curious sign for the London Underground station. It was one of
the underlying bass lines that had been destroyed. Some still used the
tunnels, others did not dare. Fear that the beasts still stirred down in
the depths. To be fair to them the last beast was indeed found in those
tunnels. It was one of the bigger ones too.

Sometimes the small worms would pop up, and they were a problem if they
infested and animated something after the fact, but by and large they
were manageable. Beasts are never fun to encounter. In the end they shot
it. No, they blew it up. Putting an end to the cacophony of the beasts
which had in the first place chased away the London underground's
bassline. Chased out the entire symphony for a time. Replacing it with
their own din.

As she neared Buck's palace she could see the imposing walled city of
Whitehall. Searchlights gazed from on high next to the wall. Keeping a
watch on their composition. Ironically the rest of the notes shrunk into
an interlude as one approached its border. This would be no place rest
not even for a moment. She knew her destination already. She could see
it a note on the page as the composition regained some density and body.
It was once a bar and now it was a bar again. The note coming to occupy
the same place on the music sheet even if it was made by a different set
of hands. She walked in to Evans holding court in the Deadenders, her
drinking establishment.

The bar was filled with swirling smoke and it seemed both livelier but
more militarized than usual. There were the dpm and berets of average
British squaddies but then other uniforms. It was the Americans. They
had strayed far from their hunting grounds. There were two green zones
in London nowadays, the walled city of Whitehall and the Embassy grounds
south of the river. The original US embassy had been long since
destroyed but the Battersea tower still stood and so that is the place
they occupied, fortified, and expanded. They came to occupy and retrofit
the Battersea PowerStation once again into a power station of their own.
What is a symbol of American power without its own power grid. Evans was
busy dealing with the new clientele regaling them about one story or
another but still she spared Whiskey a nod as she entered. The story she
was telling was likely not one she was herself involved with but one she
heard from a patron and now wore as her own. Whiskey took a seat in a
secluded booth. Her ears twitched towards the sound teasing the words
out from the background noise.

Evans was surrounded by the soldiers as she continued her story, "we
were together, fighting the final beast of London, in the tunnels of the
old London Underground, the metro system here, there were twenty
different sets of leg arranged haphazardly around the body, and the body
itself was as large as the trains that used to go around the depths. It
had so many teeth and mouths on every part of it. No, it was bigger, it
was bigger than the tunnels, it was so big that it left cracks behind in
the tunnels it was so big, mounds of flesh, growing out and out. Anyway,
we filled it full of incendiary, good old incendiary .556 like you guys
use and after an eternity it finally died. So, did you guys see any
action like that today? No way that you did."

Whiskey stepped over at the break in the story, "It was not twenty sets
of legs, it was thirty and you could hear the sounds of the bones
breaking in each leg and regrowing as it moved around the tunnels. The
scariest thing was not the bone noises, not even the smell. That's what
Evans told me anyway." Whiskey said to expand the mythology as she
patted Evans on the shoulder and gave her a grin.

"That's right! It was so big!" Evans said trying to continue the
embellishment.

Whiskey toyed with the idea of piling on more details making it even
more discordant with the reality of that night until it became
unbelievable. Though for new squaddies and new Americans perhaps they
would not understand where the boundary between reality and fiction were
in things related to the zone. It was after all a place where history
and myth intersected into an indiscernible miasma. Most of all she
wanted service though and a free drink there was no way she was going to
take on the Russians sober. Not without a drink and a smoke in fact and
there was no other bar where she could entertain the notion of drinking
for free.

"That beast was something else. You remember, you were there weren't you
Evans? I wish I could have been there. To see how the mission went."
Whiskey placed more emphasis on every word. Trying to spell out that if
she did not get Evans' attention then the jig would be up. Besides as
much as Whiskey did love Evans dearly, she was not about to let her tell
that story without trying to put a bit of distance between her and the
persons involved. It was not an easy night.

"Yeah, it was, anyway guys, have a good night, hope you get some stories
like that to tell while you're here." Evans lifted her glass up and took
a small sip as the soldiers following her spirit but not her actions
took gulps of their beer.

As Whiskey and Evans walked to that small secluded booth Evans gave her
a glare. "I was just getting the business to roll in, not like you care,
always drinking off of my tab."

"I wouldn't have cared if you weren't trying to pass off my story as
yours." Whiskey gave a serious look.

Evans gave out a sigh. "I'm sorry, look I didn't know that you were
going to come tonight, but its nice to see you. Those guys are nice but
it takes it out of you to talk to them all you know. Keep the energy up.
I guess it's nice to have a break, besides he can always step in." She
gestured her head towards the other bar tender, her business partner a
male mutie with a monkey tail. "It's a good time for Jack to go in and
get some experience with customers anyway. The freak show might be nice
for them."

"Why are they here, so many of them anyway?" Whiskey knew the answer but
it was always safer to act like you knew less than you knew and bait
other people into revealing what they knew. Besides Evans was not by any
stretch of the imagination bound by any laws. Not that Whiskey really
was either but it would be worse for her business working with the state
than it would be for Evans. If news made its way to a barkeep then it
was beyond any reasonable means of enforcement.

"They're trying to make a new green zone, nearer to the middle of town,
just a small one but in that old embassy of theirs the one with the gold
eagle. They were going around cleaning it out apparently." Evans said
with no reservations.

"Long way from Battersea, or Cambridge aren't they?" Whiskey asked but
fumbled the delivery.

"Look I know you're probing me for information, on a job are we? Or just
looking for military secrets for fun?" Evans shot back. "I'm your
friend, I'm sorry about earlier but you don't need to bullshit me to get
me to tell you info."

"Sorry. Look. Today. This job is going to be fine I know it is. My
calves hurt a bit the job, it's out by London city airport, it's quite
far so I'm just taking some time to relax here before moving onto the
next leg. I need a drink, and normally it wouldn't bother me you telling
my stories. It's just today I guess, I keep on thinking back to that
night." Whiskey said in a different and decidedly earnest tone compared
to before.

"I get it. Your usual today then? Whiskey on the rocks, your namesake?"
Evans got up and paused. "You have your lighter?" Whiskey held up her
shiny metal zippo. "Your cigarettes of choice would be menthols right?"
Whiskey did not actually like Menthols but Evans did and if that's what
her friend was smoking then she would indulge too.

Whiskey nodded and Evans got out of the booth and set about preparing
everything. Jack was a strange name for a mutie, but maybe nowadays
people were okay with that. Fancy that. Thinking about us and seeing us
as regular people same as anyone or anything else. People with regular
names. Regular wants and dreams. People who want to be treated
regularly. She needed that drink and that cigarette. To dissolve that
thought pattern in alcohol. Burn it away with the smoking cigarette.
Stub it out. Evans was quick in bringing over the necessary medicine and
the application was equally quick.

"I've always wondered why you'd ask for it on the rocks if you were just
going to shotgun it like that." Evans asked.

"I just needed it." Whiskey said.

"Well let me get you another few then." Evans said getting up.

Whiskey took in that cigarette taking a long drag. She could hear the
sound of the flame burning as she breathed in. Evans came back with her
drinks. Whiskey looked into her eyes and said two words "Thank you." She
meant them the most of any words she had said that day. They were also
the last words she remembered saying that day.

# Chapter 3

The final stage of the journey would involve another rest stop in the
last place the symphony could still be heard in full, the last place to
gain a rest more wholesome than squatting in some dilapidated room where
your company could be a rat, a dead body or another squatter. The only
people who lived past the old center of the city where those unable to.
There were isolated communities all dancing to their own tune but few of
them in the doldrums of the old suburbs. What civilization there was
clung to the riverside. As the yellow zone gave away to the orange zone.
Except Liverpool Street, the gateway to the remains of London. The mouth
through which the body could eat whatever vagrants had journeyed their
way towards the city. It was not the only port of entry. The city
boundary was fuzzy, and there was no real central authority to
distinguish the line. Liverpool street was just tailored towards it.
Well connected by roads that had been cleared during the reclamation
effort. The road between Liverpool Street and Cambridge stood as one of
the few motorways which was not still clogged by twisted metal. While
other routes were available it was the path of least resistance to cling
to the roads. Still surfaced, on occasion still used officially. The
checkpoints largely tapered out a few miles out of Cambridge but the
clear road remained. What entered the city over land entered through
Liverpool Street.

This was the place where she took her rest. Nothing fancy, a tea at a
cheap stall. It was warm and not much else. It was too expensive for
what it was. There was no escaping it, she needed it. She lingered
around the stalls and the old benches where the various dregs of society
accumulated. The edge of civilization meant it was a popular waystation.
There were comings and goings. Though it inhabited the large station
concourse it did not use it. The rails stood ready and waiting to accept
trains that would never come. Up the line there was one train that lay
forlorn on its side. It had been converted into the cheapest travelling
accommodation in the vicinity. A sleeping bag on a derailed train. The
owner would give you cigarettes for free if he liked you though. That
would have been an incentive for Whiskey to draw near, were she still in
the owner's good graces. As such she tried to find anywhere else that
was cheap. She did have her own sleeping bag, but leaving the warm
hubbub of civilization gave her a sense of pause.

She needed her wits about her, her senses sharpened, she needed her
memory to plan. It was not as though she could not go into a darker
deeper part of town after a night out. She had done so before, but the
key difference being part of a group, part of a team. To go out to forgo
sleep and rest is like trying to keep a pencil that is constantly
writing sharp, it is bound to burn down into the pencil. Her longest
record without sleep was during the Portsmouth reclamation. Forty-two
hours, rolled into a British army unit. All she need do was keep her
eyes open, keep her senses going, letting the memories meld and bleed
into each other. Any other time drifting away from her. Only here, now.
Listening to orders. Listening for beasts. Looking for any movement
anything out of the ordinary. Until the cavalry came to rescue them.
Operating alone and a few years older she could not afford such a
degraded sensory environment. Not when she was master and commander of
her own operation. She was to scout sure, but scouting required only the
sharpest senses.

It was such a set of conclusions that paved her way towards the Upper
Crust. She was not familiar with the patron of this establishment but
gave the man standing outside with a gun a nod. An armed man outside
usually did enough to deter would be criminals considering there were
much easier pickings from those without the money to buy into somewhere
to sleep. Even if the reward was greater, the slight risk was infinitely
larger than little to no risk. Behind some crudely constructed blackout
curtains was a cashier and a sign with prices. After handing over the
amount of money which was a little more expensive than she had hoped she
took out her sleeping bag and settled down in the bottom left corner.
She had instinctively moved toward the bottom right but found it already
occupied. As far from the door as possible. She fell asleep quickly and
woke up suddenly but rested enough. It was now dark outside. She nodded
to the guard and carried on her way.

First, she made her way to whatever remained of Tower Gateway station
and along whatever remained of the DLR. Discerning eyes could trace the
tracks, the great causeway that once wandered its way down the city. She
was careful not to be led astray by false tracks, by collapsed old
buildings that in their undeath could resemble the bones of the old DLR.
She took in the night, feeling the wind, the cold nipping at the tips of
her ears, the new and different ears she had now. Letting them twitch,
letting them create a soundscape of our environment. She could hear the
worms burrowing. Her eyes could catch glimpses of them in the rubble.
There were no colonies of them so far, no clumps together, holding
buildings in their legion grasp. Though if they ever got that big there
would be a job for it. Instead, there was shuffling in the rubble. She
could hear the high-pitched song of their electric dance. The siren song
of the orange zone.

A dancing piece of rubble made its way across her path. The blue
luminous lines animating the decaying urban bones. She readied her
rifle, her Sasha, loaded with incendiary. Eyes fixed, hands steady but
still quivering. Her breath hung in the air blocking her sight. Were the
worms not bright and glowing she could not see them, but even so it
would be hard to miss a dancing concrete slab. She pulled down the
trigger, sending each shot individually. There was a brilliant flash of
fire at the foot of the slab. The smoke and fire as she fired again, and
again. Then silence. The electric hum having been banished. The slab
stood still. The bones stayed dead. It was an indulgence. Would have
been better to just ignore, to evade. The sound of gunfire was distinct
and it may attract attention. Not to mention the rounds she used may be
useful later. She moved on quickly. Not jogging but at the same time not
slowly. Still, she still had it, her shots landed on target. The foe was
felled. She needed to know that she still had it in her.

She continued her march onwards and once she was apart from the place
she felled the worms she repacked her magazine. Though this time with
simple full metal jacket rounds. They had the names of unknown Russian
soldiers already written on them; she could read the invisible death
certificates as she packed them in. She could only hope that there were
no such rounds with her name on them. Though they could not kill her.
She was steel. She could not be felled so easily. It began to rain as it
often did, drizzle as it was once called. She pulled a hood over her
head.

The area around London city airport was less decayed, there were two
towers still standing. The smell of sugar still hung in the air from the
long-destroyed sugar factory. As though it still clung to the air. Even
with the rain. The memory of what this place once was. She had to be
careful now. There were floodlights where the airport contacted the
mainland. Looks like someone had occupied the airport after all, and it
was likely the Russians. There was commotion, the roads were clear. The
hum of civilization all the more disquieting for how silent it should
be. It made her skin crawl. Usually, she was soothed but here it felt
somehow unnatural, as though the symphony was conducted with rigidity
and the instruments played by puppets. There were three towers still
standing somehow south of the runway. Slowly she made her way around.
There were patrols of soldiers making their rounds around a supposedly
quiet sector. She dodged them, stepping quietly until she reached the
first tower. It did not appear occupied, except for the worms. Perhaps
they were the ones keeping it upright. The sound the hum growing
stronger and stronger as she made her way. She could not see them. Not
in those densely packed corridors.

Flat by flat, floor by floor. Worm infested though it may be she could
tell a good vantage point when she saw it. One of the flats the door
stood open. It had decayed in its years of emptiness yet a mug still
stood alone on a table. She walked towards it. The sports direct
branding still visible. The tea had been rendered to a putrid mulch by
the years. Still, whoever last crossed this threshold, other than the
newly wormy occupants might have expected to return, leaving their tea
half drunk. Did they live, did they die. There was nothing that the old
room could tell. It was a means of wasting time as she gathered the
volition to continue up and up. Then she stopped. There was a sound. It
clawed into the back of her mind. Now she knew why this was not used as
a vantage point by the soldiers. There was the faint high-pitched whine
up there. Well either the Russians were sloppy, or it was a recent move
on their account, or that which made the noise was a new occupier.
Instead, she made her way down the staircase. She had not been thinking
about the possibility of a patrol. Just because she thought her sounds
were masked by worms did not mean they were. For the high-pitched sound
was not within the range of hearing for everyone. An adjustment she had
yet to get used to.

"остановка," was the single shrill word that came from the soldier's
mouth, as she felt the warmth of a flashlight on her.

A request she was not meaning to honor. Normally she would flee upwards
where she had the advantage, but she was not going to risk going up
above. Instead, she darted forward. Jumping her calves bending as she
dived for cover. Instead of the hail of bullets they tried to parley
with her. Underpaid conscripts sent out on night orders, they do not
want to fight or die. Shame they ran into her. She gripped the Welrod,
holding the wire grip. As if the steel could give her the resolve. It
had to be done. There was nothing else for it she told herself. She
darted forward. Before the impulse to shoot, before he even registered
the sight of the girl with cat ears in front of him there was a bullet
in his brain. Putting a hard sharp stop to any action. The sound was
remarkably quiet to the point that to the other soldiers the fact that
their comrade had been shot had not been registered. A fatal mistake for
the second soldier who would soon find another bullet planted in his
brain. The third and final soldier made the fatal mistake of reaching
for his radio and not his weapon. Perhaps he just sought the comfort of
authority as the situation his brain flailed for anything to comfort him
in the situation he struggled to register. Mistakes are punished by
death.

She could smell the blood. The sweet sickly metallic smell. At least she
could not taste it. At least it was their blood and not hers. There was
nothing else for it. She examined the bodies. There was nothing of
interest except a single satchel charge held by the one who tried to use
the radio. She deliberately avoided looking at their IDs. Instead
searching for anything else. The radio would be a problem but if she
twisted the top then interference could be blamed on incompetence. A
broken radio was more believable than an open radio. She took the
satchel charge, the fuse. It was so old fashioned. Clearly, they were
not sending their best, or perhaps they did not think it necessary to
send their best. Either way it led to the same result and either way
whatever was left of the Royal Army was being chewed up maintaining the
Bristol wall, and the Americans were too busy pratting about on embassy
expeditions to find themselves here. If it could be done cheaply then it
did not really matter either way.

There were the makings of a plan in her head. Scouting mission this may
have been till she killed three conscripts. Conscripts do not just die.
She considered feeding them to the worms. Though the animated meat
strewn together by worms would eventually be found and examined. No, she
wanted to do more. She wanted to prove to good old DI that she still had
it. It was the pride and hubris in her heart that drove her forward.
Closer and closer to the bottom of the building. The supports of the
building in the basement. That is where the sound was the strongest.
There they were, thousands of them filling the supports, unable to move
anywhere but up pinned in place by the pressure of that building. To say
nothing of what was in the God's above calling out. The whimpering. They
were both tied together. Still. If one support were to be severed the
whole building would likely be felled and what was laid to rest at the
top would be flung into an encampment of Russian troops. The best-case
scenario for them would be heavy losses, at worse the entire contingent
would be wiped out. Mission accomplished.

Now she had to make sure she took out the right support, so the building
collapsed just so to land on the airport. Perhaps it would be the final
landing that air strip would ever receive. She took out a compass. If
she blew the closest pillar the imbalance combined with the worms would
propel the tower into an inevitable collision course with the ground. If
only she had some devil paste to soothe the friction. She had sold her
last cannister a long time ago for booze. None of the artefacts she once
had ended up surviving her drunken selling spree to facilitate further
drinking. It was intended as a farewell party in a manner of speaking.
Still no point dwelling on it. She stopped half way through turning
back. Never to be the same again.

She took the charge, and set the fuse carefully before pressing it into
the charge. It was ten minutes. Ten minutes to head towards the airport
entrance. Ten minutes. There were names now. Men who breathed who would
not for the machinations of a timer that ticked away far from their
earshot. Ten minutes. Every second hung as an eternity. She rushed
towards the most fortified place. Knowing that the garrison would be
taken surprised and pressed into rapid service to contend with what lay
ahead.

Whiskey remembered the first time she had to contend with the Green
Knight, the faint sound of the air bumping against a thousand blades.
Thinner than glass. A slight distortion in the air. A thousand blades, a
thousand threads, a thousand teeth, for a thousand mouths. Dangerous to
walk through, not compatible with survival when thrown at high enough
velocity to disrupt the anomaly. Leaving a trail of beheaded corpses.
They were soldiers. They were here in a foreign country occupying land
that was not theirs. Who cares if they became beheaded corpses. Who
cares if they left friends and widows behind. It was war. The only
reason they hesitated to do the same to her was lack of experience, lack
of backbone. Anxiety, cowardice, and hesitation were lethal. You learned
or you died. Those soldiers would never get the same chance to learn.
Just like so many comrades lost to anomalies. That's life. C'est la vie.

Ten minutes. She assumed a position behind cover. There were several
guards smoking, some standing behind machine guns. The fuses counted
down to the deaths. She did not know what was on the runway. Who were in
the path of all those silent blades. There was a far-off crack as the
charge finally broke. A tremendous crash. The building proved woefully
inadequate at reaching the runway. The furthest any of it got was
clattering against the concrete wall, with some scattered parts of it
reaching the water. It appears she underestimated the distance and
height. Still the air was filled with the humming of a thousand worms
now freed, the pressure bursting over everywhere such that there was a
wriggling line of blue in the sky.

It was not what she intended, far less lethal, but it led to a commotion
in the airport as the guards stood to attention. There would have to be
some recon. Then the most peculiar thing happened. There was the sound
of an explosion. A secondary coming from the airport. Followed by
another and then a larger explosion. There was screaming. Then the worms
started to limber up. As they sowed together the bones of the building
and followed the warmth of burning fire and explosives. The front of the
airport was in chaos. There was only a single guard there. The cigarette
had long since left his lips as he gripped his machine gun.

What was going on behind his eyes? There was probably little more than
the animalistic fear pulsing through the shaking trigger finger.
Clinging to that which he thought would provide him salvation and
safety. The sound of chaos, death and gunfire continued behind him. The
round that passed through his neck answered the fear drenched question
in the back of his mind. He would be next. Whiskey's FAL, her Sasha
smoked from the muzzle. Then she watched and waited for a stir. To see
if any of his comrades would notice, if they would come to take his
place. After she sat listening to the far-off screaming, the crack of
gunfire, the humming in the air of a thousand worms acting together.
Sitting there behind rubble listening to the night. To the final screams
of men. Only listening. Trying not to think to stifle and drown any
guilt any thoughts that those screams were caused by her.

Once she was quite sure the coast was clear, Sasha was stowed away, it
was the Welrod's time to shine. There was a stink in the air. The
screaming had started to die down. There was only so many lungs to
scream. There was still the hum in the air. Then a sudden thud. The
ground thundered with the sudden shockwave. The hum ceased. As a
thousand tiny lives spluttered out into nothing. Silence crept in. It
was time for the survivors to huddle together. To take time to make
sense of the minutes of carnage, minutes that would change the years,
the decades of countless people. It would not matter. It was not over.
There were still bullets left bound for the cerebral cords of men loaded
into her Welrod. The power had gone out and no-one had sought to
intervene. There was the smell of rust. Of men bleeding.

Whiskey hung to the shadows. There was a commotion of words in a foreign
language. Screams interspersed with words. They seemed to be flooding
into the lobby filling it as a makeshift CASEVAC area. The smell of
antiseptic filled the air. There was something else too. It was sweeter
than sweet, sweeter than the sugar from the long dead factory. It sent a
chill down her spine. Devil paste. She tried to tease the nature of what
was going on, she saw a doctor, or perhaps a soldier opening a canister
and fill a syringe. Then use it to seal wounds. Trying to maintain a
thin enough film so that it created a seal but not so much that the two
pieces of flesh would be constantly sliding against each other. It was
not unknown to any redeemers. Devil's paste was a miracle in a bottle,
but it was just as common to know someone who had screwed it up. It had
to be thinner than anything. Still, it might hold wounds for a while.
Still, it worked best against the fine blades of the green knight, less
good against the wounds caused by shrapnel and explosions, but anyone
who had been through that anomaly deserved treatment first. Otherwise,
they would slowly bleed out.

Whiskey crept forward. The beast wherever it was seemed to be contained
still. They would know if it was not. The screams served to drown out
her footsteps incredibly effectively. The men whose screams came by her
hand at least peripherally. Past the entrance foyer there was a strong
iron door where the guts of the baggage system once wormed their way
into the logistics chain. Past deprecated check in desks for an airport
that was now dead and buried. There was the hum of a generator, the red
light of a backup generator. More alive than the bodies outside in the
makeshift clinic. As the ranks of the dead grew and grew step by step.

There was a heavy-set door right there. This had to be it. The door had
a nice lock on it, it would have taken some time to open if it were not
already open, beckoning her beyond. On the other side was a laboratory,
several specimens dancing in solution. There were beast body parts, the
smell of devil paste, and so many other priceless artefacts besides. So
many lifetimes of redeemers, so much blood congealed and coagulated into
this dusty room. The beast had to be somewhere but this room seemed much
too small to contain one unless it was some form of aberrant. She had no
need of a flashlight clarified senses as she looked out into the dark,
the red light of the backup generators.

As she made her way through the entrails of the lab she heard a clang,
first one then another. It was not getting closer instead it sat there.
Sound. Bang bang bang bang. Over and over. She stepped towards it. There
was a great chamber that reeked. The smell of shit and pennies. Of dead
bodies. It was made more intense by the ventilation system that was
running rougher on the backup power. In the middle there was meat. Only
meat, and as she stepped into this chamber the floor felt warm through
her boot. Unusually so. It was wet. Like the floor was sweating. The
floor tensed and as it did the film of flesh bounced against the floor
making rhythmic bangs. Something was alive. The flesh seemed to tense up
like a tarpaulin around a central point. It was a metal sarcophagus with
the meat stretching out from its rusted edges. In, out, and held in
place by the lid. Whatever it was lay behind it. It had to be the beast.
She regretted not taking explosives. Walking back, she found a view onto
the flesh where she was not stepping on it, but she was also able to
shoot at it. Loading incendiary, she waited for the flesh to tense up
took in a breath and tightened her finger on the trigger. The typical
smoke trail, then crack, then flash rang out in the room. It hurt a lot
particularly in such a confined space the sound bouncing around. The
banging ceased.

She fired a second and third shot for good measure. The film stopped
moving and black blood started leaking from it like from a soy sauce
packet. Then it contracted the black liquid pushing out and through the
corridor, it was warm and sticky. It smelled like sap and fat, as oil
congealed on top of it. The clanging gave way to the sound of grinding
as the sarcophagus started to move pushing open. A hissing of something.
It was human shaped as it came out of its box. Whiskey pulled up her
rifle again and this time fired again at the target the bullets cracked
and burned. They pierced straight through the center of mass. It turned
towards her, as it started to inflate a film around it. It lifted up
into the air and let out a scream. It started to crackle and move up and
down the register. This was something else. She knew the sound a
threshold was opening up right here.

There was a commotion as the Russians whichever ones were still able to
move started to thunder up the passageway. They probably would have
taken issue with Whiskey had they noticed her, but there was a much more
pressing issue at hand. There were now several muzzle flashes joining
her and the bullets started to be distorted. Trajectories bending with
the sound and piercing into the group of soldiers. They kept on shooting
all the way until the end. She knew it was coming. They knew it was
coming. A stirring in her guts with the sound. Slowly coming to
anticipate it. The thunderous crack as the room started to fray at the
seams. The room started to fold into itself. A meaningless sea of metal
and light and matter. Of atoms and quarks. Crack, crack, crack. Scream,
scream, scream. Light, light, light. Guts, guts, guts. What was a person
in this sea of meaningless signals. The chaos of the universe finally
embodied and encapsulated in a confined space. She let go of her rifle.
Clatter, clatter, clatter. Bang, bang, bang. Flash, flash, flash.

# Chapter 4

This was her fourth time here. In this white room. No, her fifth time.
Three times from without, twice from within. The final light flashing
through her visual cortex. It should have been the swansong of life.
Maybe for someone else their life would be flashing in front of them.
Every memory, every good day, every smile. Everything that made a life
worth remembering. Perhaps it was just so that she was given respite
from the recollection. A burned-out husk of slag pounded over and over
and over and over. Dents inflicted from within and without. Nothing
better for a pig iron plate as herself. One that kept on inserting
itself into every single application. Never up to the task, but always
wanting to interrupt. Sent out on a mission to put the runway out of
commission and now all of this. It was just what she deserved. This
white room. It was going to start dissipating now, as the memory of what
light was left her mind. The inky blackness started to fill her up.
There was no boundary anymore, no light to distinguish. There was only
the inky dark. It was familiar now. Not that she welcomed it or could
welcome it. Or that it would care if she did or did not. It was all that
there was anymore. All that would be.

The sensation of waking back up was always one of excruciating pain. The
body began to reset itself. The muscles and tendons snapping back into
place painstakingly stitching themselves back together. Her body that
had dissolved was reconstituting itself and she could feel every part of
the sensation. All the pressure pressing down on her. The wetness of the
blood she lost. The wounds that made them slowly reversing and falling
back into place. Her head stung worse than cigarette withdrawals like
part of her mind was so preoccupied with the pain it was unable to fully
rebuild itself. The pain occupying so much of it that was all she could
think of. It was worse than a hangover. It was even worse than usual.
The injuries that charted the course of death more extensive than they
had been before. Recovering from a fatal gunshot wound was usually
simple. The brain would start to fall back into place and there were not
any pain receptors there. The skull was trickier and a little more
painful but usually pretty quick. There were fewer muscles that needed
to be set into place again. This time it was everywhere. It was so
everywhere and always.

She tried to open her eyes but her mind had not been configured for that
quite yet. She did not know if she was opening her eyes, if her brain
had the capability to process images just yet. Instead, there was
blackness. She tried to move her arm but there was no movement or
sensation. She could feel something in her legs. The burning pain of the
calves now growing back on the bone nestling themselves in the right
places to facilitate movement. She just lay there assumedly for a
moment. It might have been silent it might not have been. All she could
do was wait to be washed back up from that inky black shore. Bit by bit,
pain and faculties returning. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

When she started to come to, she could see the husk of the metal room.
It had been blown apart sometimes with straight lines sometimes with
curved lines or cracks. The deconstruction of the antechamber was total
and she could feel the wind on her face and the cold morning air. The
sunrise had come and gone at this point. There was the smell of shit and
pennies from the dead soldiers around her. She was the solitary survivor
of sorts. Getting up was a struggle. The pain still jagged and still
pressing into her. She was lucky that there had been some kind of blast
that kept her clear of the rubble. The thought of being forced to live
and then die and be resurrected in excruciating pain four more times was
not exactly something she was enamored with. Though it would at least be
the end of all this. It was a little tempting but not for today.

To her surprise there was no threshold even if she had thought there was
one opening up. Instead there was the rather elementary scene of a room
blown apart albeit in pretty creative ways. It was more like a modern
art exhibit than something truly otherworldly. Her uniform was totaled.
Not totaled exactly but full of holes to the point it compromised the
insulative efficiency of it. That was to say she felt cold. She limped
back towards the way she came. There was the smell and the silence.
There was not a single soul left alive. For a moment she wondered if
there was a soul left in London. The silence giving her a disquieting
answer for now. It was not terribly likely that it was all over but when
she needed the reassurance of life there was nothing terribly
forthcoming. As she approached the makeshift medical tent she saw a
scene of death. There was nothing left. Nobody left. It looked quick at
least, rubble crushing much of it.

She made her way towards anywhere less bombed out trying to find a
barracks. She needed something new to wear even if she did not terribly
want to wear a Russian uniform it was not as though other options were
terribly forthcoming. As she walked the length of the bombed-out
terminal eventually she found an area that backed onto some tents. The
tents too were full of holes but this appeared to be where the men
slept. She looked in the footlocker and found a uniform. It was not well
made and did not have any lining but it was something she could wear.
Instead of stripping she opted to take the oversized clothes and wear
them atop of her tattered uniform. She left it all behind. Sasha was
nowhere to be found and the Webley was gone. That would be an annoying
apology to make. It would be annoying to rearm in the first place. Just
as annoying as rearming itself as her arm continued to scream.

Where from now. Where to go. She could only walk. Try to find signs of
life. Then a flash of an idea in her head. The Green Zone it had to be
the Green Zone. The office with that detective in it. It would be a bit
of a walk. On unsteady feet as she walked like a newborn foal. Her mind
filled with nothing than the static of motion. Each foot in front of the
other over and over. Over and over. Over and over. Foot in boots. Boots
in feet. Feet in steps. Steps in feet. Boots in steps. Steps in boots.
Holes in boots. There were holes in her boots. She had not even thought
about it yet but now as her feet started reforming themselves and the
synapses clicked back into place, she could feel the cold morning breeze
conducted through her feet. Cold, cold, cold. Step, step, step. The
journey continued. She did not know the way in her mind but she knew it
in her feet guiding herself along the river in a contraflow. Stepping
against the current of her body. The cold and the pain searing into her.
Step after step. Limping now. Her left leg dragged against her trying to
go with the current. Still, she kept on stepping. It would be hours. In
a dazed state she made her way. Foot, foot, foot, foot. Forward,
forward, forward. River, river, river.

It hurt. It hurt. It would not, not hurt. Her mind imprisoned in such a
way that she could never imagine it not hurting. Yet still she carried
on. It was far from one foot in front of the other and far more of a
limping motion with one better more composed leg slowly being guided
forward press by press by the other leg. Something she was conscious of.
Trying to maneuver her foot and her leg in the best way to minimize
pain. Moving her arms in the best way to minimize agony. The pain
pressing into her like an obstacle course that only she could feel.

The green zone was a hive of activity as trucks came and went. The wall
had been blown in places and all of the buildings had been struck by
rocks and stones coming from an easterly direction. Like an earthquake
the eerie jagged wounds on the buildings. There were blast marks around
the doors and signs of breaking and entering. It was hard to tell where
the natural disaster ended and the human disaster began. There were
people in cuffs being lined up outside the buildings and soldiers all
around. Inside the medley of men was DI Mortazavi. He had a bloody nose
and had been cursing all morning. Cursing after the mangy cat who was
limping her way towards him. The situation was stable and the only
people bleeding or with blankets over them had been security who had
tried to resist in the confusion. That being said men with guns around
unarmed civilians tied up, can often deteriorate into men with guns
surrounded by dead bodies. As such it was weighing on the commander to
try and keep the tense situation under control.

Colonel Dawson stood around his men. Surrounded by communications
officers patching him through to the embassy. As he was on the phone
with the Ambassador he was directing men, lining them up and getting the
unarmed office staff and civil servants onto trucks. It had been a long
day. It was noon but the operation began in earnest around 2am a couple
hours after the event at London city. He had a cigarette in his mouth.
The smell of the bodies had begun to permeate so his first focus was
getting the stench of death away and making sure there were not any more
corpses to get out of the way. The most difficult part was the
residential areas and he still had not figured out what the hell to do
about horse guards, the big stronghold. They could not just take it down
with an airstrike. It would be too much too violent of an action. Sure,
they were doing a coup around London but giving the circumstances and
the professionalism he had maintained it could be seen as just
stabilizing the frontier. He was trying to get the embassy to go through
with some kind of diplomatic solution. He could lay siege to the place
too which was the best option once he had wrapped up here. He hung up
and took another drag of his cigarette.

As the cat walked up. She was still bleeding. Carrying a haggard
rucksack unconsciously. One foot in front of the hour. The Russian
uniform caused quite a stir among the American guards. Yet she did not
seem armed. As Colonel Dawson was handed a report by the bemused guards
he reasoned that she was a survivor from the airport. Whatever
information was in that brain might be useful. Thus they were to
apprehend her and send her on the next transport to the embassy. She
walked towards the walls. Oblivious of the armed guards and its
destroyed state. There was nothing running in those circuits besides the
single word, forward. Rung around it was fences of pain that blocked
much of a deeper thought. She was easy to apprehend. She was already
looking for a set of arms to collapse into. Comfort in another human
being that she greedily and undeservedly lapped up. An unknown soldier.
Anyone would do. The angelic wings of absolution holding around her. She
could let go finally.

When she woke up it was as though no time had passed at all. Unlike the
unfathomably long dark of before. She knew the flavor on her lips metal
and smoke and dirt. The shape too. The barrel of a gun, the muzzle, the
compensator. She opened her eyes. Opened her nose. The body she had was
still dull and aching. The muscles snapping together still in some
places. Maybe some function would not ever return. There was the smell
of smoke but not blood. Her hands were tied behind her back and in front
of her was Colonel Dawson a black man, toned and tall but not overtly
muscular. He had a cigarette in his mouth. A small mountain behind him
smoldering away in an ashtray. Next to him was a bespectacled young man
with a book open. Russian dictionary field manual, as though he was the
poor pitiless private tasked with learning Russian for the Russian camo
clad captive now found in their midst.

"It's okay, I speak English." Whiskey piped up. Slurring her speech with
the gun in her mouth. Speaking came surprisingly naturally back to her.
Though there was a slight pain in the left side of her mouth the muscles
still locked up.

The private seemed to relax instantly. No, he was not a private a
lieutenant marked by the epaulets on his shoulder. American from the
uniform.

"You a Rusky? You one of them? Get that barrel out her mouth. I wanna
hear what she has to say." The colonel gestured for the soldiers to
stand back. "She's not a threat come on now, you don't need to be so
happy to go sticking your guns in mouths."

They pulled back.

"So like I said, are you one of them? You're wearing their uniform.
Holding a Welrod in a half destroyed backpack, here to kill me?" His
words were spoken as if daring her to answer yes.

"No. Actually I was sent to try and wipe them out. I got caught up in
things and well the rest of my clothes were not terribly up to the
journey across from the airport." She said very matter of factly.

"You expect me to believe that prima facie. Dressed in a Russian
uniform. Expect me to believe you were there, you survived the center of
it all." He was rocking back and forth.

"Well yes. I'm not exactly sure how I'm to go about proving it. If you
could perhaps tell me where exactly I am right now it would be most
appreciated. I was not exactly in the best position to keep track of my
location on the journey here." She tried to gesture to her head but her
arms shot in pain and the ties kept her from doing so, as such she made
a strange jerking motion.

"She's reaching for a weapon sir." One of the overeager privates piped
up.

"Quit your yapping private." The colonel shouted in his direction.
Involuntarily Whiskey tensed up. "We're in the green zone, what's left.
After the impact, if you were there though. Lieutenant Fry, over here."

The Lieutenant walked over and the two whispered for each other before
leaving the command tent.

"I see the green zone. Ah well check through my belongings mister,
colonel, was it. You should find my Mutie ID card. If we're in the green
zone then you have my employer that would be a certain DI Mortzavi,
portly learned looking fellow with a beard and dark hair." She was still
stumbling on formulating her words but was able to get it across the
finish line.

"Private, you are to go find this Detective and bring him here." Dawson
shot a glare in the overeager private's location.

With his exit it was just Whiskey and the Colonel in the command tent.
His cigarette burned to the butt, he smoked it right to the end, and so
another was added to his mouth the click of the lighter the only sound
in that place. She wanted to talk but did not feel that able to. She
felt her consciousness slipping away second by second as though she was
to fall back into sleep again. The colonel came towards her and tapped
her on the shoulder.

"Hey don't fall asleep on me we gotta figure this out first." He spoke
softer than he did with the other soldiers.

It brought her out of slumber. There was noise outside the shuffling of
feet. Mortzavi's nosebleed had dried by now but he still had an angry
look on his face, which melted away as he looked at her.

"Whiskey, you made it, what are you even doing here. What the hell are
you doing? Are you good are you." He kept on stammering

"We were going to ask you to identify this girl but it looks like you
two already know each other, she's not a Russian asset then." The
Colonel said.

"No, she isn't. Despite whatever clothes she's found rummaging around
in." The detective replied.

"Come on now I would make such a good Russian asset." Whiskey said with
a laugh which took a bit of the bite of the pain away.

The detective and colonel both glared at her but with the other soldiers
elsewhere they then glared at the private before moving on.

"Detective Mortzavi was it." The colonel looked over at the detective.

"Yes, it is."

"Would you testify, what is the name of this girl, that you have
knowledge of her, that she is not a Russian asset, and that she is not a
danger to the United States." The colonel said in the sternest voice he
had used apart from that which he had used on his direct underlings.

"I Detective Inspector of Reformed New Scotland Yard, do testify that
this Mutant, known commonly as Whiskey, is a person with whom I have had
substantial correspondence and would be willing to prove that in further
questioning with due time for discovery, that she is not to my knowledge
a Russian asset and has been cleared by both the Ministry of Justice and
MoD, Ministry of Defense serving in various roles and serving her
country with distinction, in light of this and her history as part of
joint operations with US forces I do not believe that she harbors any
ill will towards the United States, nor would she be a danger to them."
He spoke calmly but a bit raggedy he knew the script but populating it
with the particular words the colonel needed to hear took more mental
bandwidth than he was anticipating.

The colonel looked satisfied. "Okay, I guess we can talk. She served
with US forces? Where did she serve? Wait, first you." Gesturing towards
first Whiskey before looking at her cat ears, and then to the stricken
detective. "You hold your fingers over your ears, and you, Whiskey,
whatever it was, you speak quietly to me. Tell me what campaigns you
served in."

"I was at the tail end of the London campaign and Portsmouth as well as
some cleanup operations between Portsmouth and Bristol, I started
working, working in the black zone for a couple of years, while also
cleaning out whatever people stumbled on in London. Over the past couple
of months I've just been doing work around the capital, mostly
investigating things, any zone related phenomenon, but also a little wet
work here and there." Whiskey said perhaps a bit too honestly though at
least she accidentally avoided saying the most potentially incriminating
things she could have.

The colonel furrowed his brow. "Okay." He gestured towards the
detective. "Your turn."

"She served in the London campaign, the liberation of London City
airport, the Richmond campaign, as well as cleanup operations in the
capital before the wind down of London operations. She served in various
roles in Portsmouth and also fighting hard right up and into the Bristol
campaign fighting to secure the floating harbor alongside US Marines. It
is no understatement to say she owes her life to US support, and several
US servicemen owe her their lives. I would not have worked with her, nor
would her clearance into the green zone have been cleared otherwise."
This time the detective was more confident.

"Well, I guess I can't argue with that. You two do know each other. I
guess I have one last question, why are you wearing that Russian getup?"
The colonel took a slow drag on his cigarette.

"I was at London City, the airport down the river, and I was knocked out
after a fight, I woke up in pain with clothes that were unfit to wear,
surrounded by dead Russians, and what's a girl to do. The camouflage
isn't exactly unflattering, I mean it's no Jietai but it is still rather
nice. I still had some facsimile of a backpack but truth be told. I
don't remember thinking about it I am rather in a lot of pain sir. If
there would be any way that you could perhaps." She looked up at both
men.

The colonel gave a sigh. "Where are you injured? Wait, you said you were
over at London City, the epicenter, and you survived? You were also at
the Russian base and survived and somehow you weren't a double agent?"
He started to raise his voice again.

The detective quickly cut in. "I had sent her on a mission to the
airport to scout it out actually. If you would allow me to go back to my
office I could retrieve the contract and case notes."

"I guess I can believe that answers one question at least partially."
The colonel looked out for a second and thought about his options. He
looked out the tent and shouted "private!"

There were footsteps and then footsteps away. They waited in silence for
a minute for her part destroyed backpack. Out of it he took the Welrod.
He counted the bullets in the magazine. "Three." He looked quixotically
trying to draw a firm conclusion from scant evidence. He looked at it
like a dirty sock found in a kitchen with an empty cookie jar. "Well you
fired and shot three times, I guess you were fighting over there."

"I did just tell you to scout, too much of a glory hound for that are
you?" Clark looked over with a smile.

"I'm not a hound. I'm a cat. But that was not in the airport, see I met
up with this conscript patrol, instead of shooting me they stood there,
one reached for a radio. I shot all three of that patrol dead. I did not
use my Welrod in the rest of the fight though, despite intending too.
There was enough loud to mask my shots. I use an L1A1 SLR but I think
that gun, she didn't make it."
