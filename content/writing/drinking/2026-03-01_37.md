title: Day 37
---

Today I wanted to drink. I wanted that irresistable interruption in my brain's normal functionality. Bang bang bang on the machine till it starts working again. Spits out the right numbers. When I don't drink I can sleep easier, but that's why it's better for me not to sleep. The sleepier I am the less bad I feel. It's hard to miss alcohol when your brain is already sending you false signals after having had a cumulative 8 hours sleep in two days.

It's also the purpose. On a mission. Have shit to do, to make the sortie run good. Come back alive. All other welfare concerns are more than is necessary. Any unnecessary elements can be severed. So long as the mission lives, so long as you maintain or enhanced your utility. Any extra feelings, anything that can interfere with the mission should be ignored. Disregard. Sever. Remove. Nullify.

Your body a reflection. The minimum necessary to survive and thrive. Jury rigged through years of genetic code piled up on top of itself. The minimum required to reproduce. All ancillary function severed. Depression a manifestation of defective genes. Trauma induced suicide a means of purging all that's unnecessary. Remove the defective genes from the pool. You'll only fuck up those who come after you. That's the purpose of it. 

Give me more, give me misery, give me pain. Give me it all. So I can justify my own sadness. I can justify my own failure and pain. Give me more so I can feel myself to be a good person.
