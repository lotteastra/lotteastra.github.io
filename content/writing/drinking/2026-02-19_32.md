title: Day 32
---

Today I wanted to drink again. The waves go up, and they come back down, and I can only get carried by them. I can imagine that I have some kind of influence over it all. Up and up I go. Down again. Face full of sand. Rip my face open and off. Show the stupid skin underneath. There's no beauty here. There's nothing of value. This brain full of fat rearranged in such a way. Full of chhemicals so special, we call them neurotransmitters, inducing the potential energy charge of consciousness. 

Each pulse making me more into the person I hate. Depening cracks, and valleys, blood vessels pumping more life into that machine. Just broken enough that the act of using it hurts. Not too broken that it can't be used. The worst kind of machine. The one that dares you to risk it. Then breaks down when you need it the most. That's the brain I have. Counting for nothing. Not ever. 

All it does is spit out lies. A make believe machine deprived of the alcohol to fuel it. Now all I can do is look at the gap between reality and my dreams and be confronted by the measure of my failure. I can never cross from one side to the other. I will never have that life that will make me happy. It is never going to happen. I'm too broken. I was always too broken. A machine that hurts to use.
