title: Day 36
---

Today I wanted to drink. My brain is so miserably tired, that I'm tryin to replicate the haze of drunkenness. It's not the genuine article but it's also not that far off it. I'm scared of the future. I guess anxiety is what they call it. As for the causal mechanism there's no need to go into that. When you see a bomb you don't care what explosive they used, you care about how to diffuse it. All other elements are ancillary to that. 

Of course I'm just the self obsessed moron to wonder about myself. To speculate about the cause of the fuse that's burning me down with it. I'm not ill. I can't be ill. I don't want to be mentally ill. I have an appointment, an assessment in two weeks. I don't want them to find me ill. I don't want them to tell me there's a problem. I know there's something broken but when I know that it's broken. When it's just me it doesn't matter. I can write that off. I can universalize it. Like I carry the same sins, the same dents, the same frayed wires as everyone else. I am the model machine. I am the same model as anyone else. There can't be something different because if there is then it's my fault. 

I don't want to feel it. I want to drink. To drown those synapses in tiredness. In booze. Put it somewhere in my brain where I won't have to feel that unease. I don't want to feel this way. To be the kind of person who thinks any tick is a countdown. I'm so tired of living like this.
