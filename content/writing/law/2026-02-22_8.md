Articles of issue
Article 26(2) TFEU Defines the Internal Market and provides the overall justification for it. Lists the four freedoms, free movement of goods, services, capital and people. 
Article 28(1) TFEU Creation of the Customs Union "he Union shall comprise a customs union which shall cover all trade in goods and which shall involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties on imports and exports and of all charges having equivalent effect, and the adoption of a common customs tariff in their relations with third countries."
Article 30 TFEU "Customs duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States. This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature."
Article 110 TFEU "No Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States any internal taxation of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic products." 

Cases on customs charges
Commission v. Italy (Art Treasures) -> Ratio, any tax that comes as a result of goods passing a border within the internal market is completely incompatible with Article 30 TFEU. This case related to the export of artworks from Italy with a tax imposed on them leaving the country.

Gaston Schul -> Good case that defines the internal market "The concept of a common market as defined by the court in a consistent line of decisions involves the elimination of all obstacles to intra-community trade in order to merge the national markets into a single market bringing about conditions as close as possible to those of a genuine internal market." 

Commission v. Italy (Statistical Levy) -> Facts, case where there was a very small nominal charge on imports, as low as necessary to maintain a government body documenting imports. Found to be in violation of Article 30, as even though the charge was nominal, any charge was found to breach Article 30 so long as it happened solely as a result of a good crossing a border. 

Donner v. Netherlands State -> Facts, Donner was ordering books from a member state and he was forced to pay the postal service of the Netherlands an extra charge on the books as they arrived. Found there was a violation between Articles 12 and 13 of the EEC Treaty, later incorporated into the TFEU 28-30 Articles. Any charge that is charged for reason of crossing a border is a violation of the articles in the treaty. Label does not matter any charge for that reason is prohibited.

Bauhuis v. The Netherlands State -> Any charge taht comes purely by means of crossing a border is illegal, and cannot be considered. 

Case 18/87 Commission v. Germany -> Set out the regulations around inspections required by EU law and charges that would violate Article 30 TFEU but do not because they are about complying with EU regulations. 
1. The Charge cannot exceed the cost of the inspection. 
2. The inspections must be obligatory and uniform for all products in the EU
3. The inspections mus be required by EU law.
4. They must facilitate the free movmeent of goods by eluminating obstacles which could arise from unilateral measures of inspection adopted by Member States in aaccordance with Article 36 TFEU.

Carbonati Apuani -> Prohibition on charges even in internal barriers. Italian marble case, where there were charges within Italy regarding moving marble out of a region of Italy, and those were held to be an Article 30 violation.

Lancry -> The French Overseas territories case, where it was held that duties within France on the importation of goods from France's colonial departments into the metropole were internal barriers and therefore violations of Article 30 TFEU. 

Diamantarbeiders -> Doesn't matter the goal or the protectionist effect.

Warehousing Charges -> Charge for a service is not a charge having equivalent effect.

Cases on discriminatory taxation Article 110

Bergandi -> MS can choose to tax as they see fit.

Humblot -> But the impact cannot be discriminatory

Commission v. Ireland -> Potatoes case, found to be in violation of Article 34 when relating to third country goods (Cyprus which was at that time outside of the EU) where Ireland required licenses for Cypriot potatoes that were already cleared for sale in the UK and freely circulating. With goods being assimilated to the country they enter the EU and are cleared for customs through, in line with Article 34 TFEU. 

Commission v. Italy (Works of Art) -> Goods are defined as products which can be valued in money and which are capable as such of forming the subject of commercial transactions.

Commission v. Belgium (Walloon Waste) -> Waste can be considered goods also. 

Van Gend en Loos -> Customs duties are explicitly prohibited under Article 30 TFEU

Belgian Diamonds Case -> Charge having Equivalent Effect (CEEs) Diamonds imported into Belgium where there was a social fund for diamond workers established, were subject to a contribution so that the fund could operate. Held to be an Article 30 violation even though the charge only amounted to 0.33% of the unworked diamond. Therefore the size of the charge is immaterial. So is the reason. Any charge that arises from crossing a border within the EU. See also Statitsical Levy. 

Statistical Levy -> Qualified that the charge must have an actual benefit to the individual importer/exporter rather than the economy as a whole. 

Dassonville -> Dassonville formula, all trading rules enacted by MS which are capable of hindering directly, or indirectly, actually or potentially any intra-community trade are to be considered as measures having an equivalent effect to quantative restrictions. 

Buy Irish Case -> Found to be a violation of Article 34 by an advertising campaign encouraging consumers to 'buy Irish,' it was argued that it didn't matter because imports actually went up during the campaign, but Dassonville, actual or potential, and since there was potential then it was captured by Article 34 TFEU. 

Cassis de Dijon Case -> Case where Germany had a law prescribing a minimum alcohol content for alcoholic spirits, which Cassis fell short of (25% required, 15-20% actual) the cases held that this constituted a Measure having Equivalent Effect and was therefore captured by article 34. INdistinctly applicable measures. 

Torfaen v. B&Q -> Case about Sunday trading there was no dsicrimination against imports in any shape or for and they weren't aimed against imports, however the court held that Article 34 TFEU had been engaged. It came as a result of the Dassonville formula being very very significant. 

Keck -> Case reversed Dassonville weakening its influence and making it so that there were two categories, product bound measures that related to the characteristics of the product and labelling, and measures relating to selling arrangements. The latter category was held to be outside the scope of Article 34 TFEU. 

Alfa Vita -> The frozen bread case where bread is half baked, frozen and transported to the supermarket. Greek legislation required venders to comply with standards on traditional bakers when the bake was thawed and rebaked. This was held not to be a selling arrangement but something to do with product characteristics. 

ANETT Case -> There was a Spanish case where there was a ban on tobacco retailers importing tobacco into the country. They were required to purchase their supplies from authorized wholesalers. This measure restricted imports and was held to be a Measure having Equivalent Effect. 

Critique of Keck on the basis of being artificial and unworkable, somewhat incorporated the criticisms of Keck, by introducing the market access test. Trailers on the back of motorbikes were banned in the Italian highlands on the basis of road safety and that amounted to effectively a ban in Italy on such things. The judgement has not brought in greater clarity. 

Cassis additional -> Extra issues related to allowance for certain restrictions, predates Article 36 TFEU, they allowed certain public interest exceptions, such as prevention of tax evation, unfair competition, and promoting consumer protection.

Oebel -> Improvement of working conditions recognized as an exception.

Commissioner v. Denmark (Returnable Bottles) -> Environmental condition also recognized as an exception. 

Debate about allowing these differing exceptions to exist while Article 36 also exists.
