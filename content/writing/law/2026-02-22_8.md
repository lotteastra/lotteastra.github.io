Articles of issue
Article 26(2) TFEU Defines the Internal Market and provides the overall justification for it. Lists the four freedoms, free movement of goods, services, capital and people. 
Article 28(1) TFEU Creation of the Customs Union "he Union shall comprise a customs union which shall cover all trade in goods and which shall involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties on imports and exports and of all charges having equivalent effect, and the adoption of a common customs tariff in their relations with third countries."
Article 30 TFEU "Customs duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States. This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature."
Article 110 TFEU "No Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States any internal taxation of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic products." 

Cases on customs charges
Commission v. Italy (Art Treasures) -> Ratio, any tax that comes as a result of goods passing a border within the internal market is completely incompatible with Article 30 TFEU. This case related to the export of artworks from Italy with a tax imposed on them leaving the country.

Gaston Schul -> Good case that defines the internal market "The concept of a common market as defined by the court in a consistent line of decisions involves the elimination of all obstacles to intra-community trade in order to merge the national markets into a single market bringing about conditions as close as possible to those of a genuine internal market." 

Commission v. Italy (Statistical Levy) -> Facts, case where there was a very small nominal charge on imports, as low as necessary to maintain a government body documenting imports. Found to be in violation of Article 30, as even though the charge was nominal, any charge was found to breach Article 30 so long as it happened solely as a result of a good crossing a border. 

Donner v. Netherlands State -> Facts, Donner was ordering books from a member state and he was forced to pay the postal service of the Netherlands an extra charge on the books as they arrived. Found there was a violation between Articles 12 and 13 of the EEC Treaty, later incorporated into the TFEU 28-30 Articles. Any charge that is charged for reason of crossing a border is a violation of the articles in the treaty. Label does not matter any charge for that reason is prohibited.

Bauhuis v. The Netherlands State -> Any charge taht comes purely by means of crossing a border is illegal, and cannot be considered. 

Carbonati Apuani -> Prohibition on charges even in internal barriers. 

Diamantarbeiders -> Doesn't matter the goal or the protectionist effect.

Warehousing Charges -> Charge for a service is not a charge having equivalent effect.

Cases on discriminatory taxation Article 110

Bergandi -> MS can choose to tax as they see fit.

Humblot -> But the impact cannot be discriminatory
