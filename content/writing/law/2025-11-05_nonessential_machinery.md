The courts’ distinction between essential and non-essential machinery for resolving
contractual uncertainties is rather arbitrary. Discuss.
Contract law acts to “provide individuals with facilities for realizing their wishes,” for an
element of that law to be arbitrary it needs to grant some wishes but not others, with no
good reason distinguishing them. This essay will evaluate arbitrariness by examining two
principal cases, evaluating if the rules within them arose arbitrarily without prior precedent,
and if they broke from prior precedent they did so with no justification, and if the rules
created are applied inconsistently. The principal cases to be dealt with are Sudbrook v.
Eggleton (Sudbrook) and Gillatt v. Sky Television (Gillatt). In Sudbrook the machinery was
held to be non-essential and when it broke down the contract could be salvaged. In Gillatt
that was not the case and the machinery was held to be essential. Overall, the rule in
Sudbrook is not arbitrary despite overturning a ‘long line of authorities,’ it did so with clear
justification. Gillatt is also not arbitrary since it gives clear justification to distinguish it from
Sudbrook.

Sudbrook, decided in 1982 represents a case that in many ways departs from long
established legal principles and in that sense, it could be seen has having arisen arbitrarily.
The machinery was held non-essential at the first instance, being overturned on appeal
through application of Milnes v. Gery (Milnes). Milnes bears a strong factual resemblance to
Sudbrook, both cases concerned a fair price to be determined by specified contractual
machinery which broke down due to non-performance by one of the parties. In Milnes the
court held in the words of Grant MR “no price having ever been fixed in that mode, the
parties have not agreed upon any price.” That the lack of agreement in the specified
machinery rendered the contract too uncertain to be enforceable, the machinery was too
essential to be severed from the contract. Without a decided price then it could be said the
price was “quasi nullo pretio statuto,” as though there was no set price. With no price and
price being an essential part of contract, there was no contract to enforce. This was a clear
rule.

Milnes would go on to be applied in other cases with a strong factual resemblance, in
particular Vickers v. Vickers and Hart v. Hart. Though it was contradicted at points for
example in Gregory v. Mighell concluded 4 years after Milnes. That being said in Sudbrook
reference was made by Lord Diplock to the notion that this “long and consistent line of
authorities [was overruled],” in Sudbrook. This reference makes clear that Sudbrook and
the rule that if machinery breaks down it can be substituted for a ‘fair price,’ so as to give
intention to the parties, arose contrary to prior precedent regarding the issue despite going
against prior precedent and thus opening the door to arbitrariness.
That being said perhaps Sudbrook represents bringing the law on non-essential machinery in
line with wider principles of English contract law. Indeed, Sudbrook is an articulation of the
modern principles of English contract law with regard to bargains. Sudbrook ultimately held
that while the court could not substitute its own machinery, the machinery was in effect to
find a fair price, and demonstrated the objective intent of the parties to sell at a fair price.
Therefore, the courts should give effect to those wishes and find a fair price. Sudbrook
merely brought the rules concerning non-essential machinery in line with the rules on non-
essential contract terms at large, as found in Nicolene v. Simmonds, Bear Stearns Bank plc.
v. Forum Global Equity ltd. and Hillias v. Arcos in that sense Sudbrook cannot be said to
have arisen arbitrarily. It arose for good reason out of the ambiguities in Milnes. It
represents a consolidation of the principle of English courts articulated by Lord Wright in
Hillas v. Arcos,
‘verba ita sunt intelligenda ut res magis valeat quam perat.’ Words are to be
interpreted so as to give effect to the subject matter rather than to defeat it. In this sense
Sudbrook may not have arisen arbitrarily and merely brought the area in line with wider
developments regarding uncertainty in English contract law at the time. However, that the
Lords in Sudbrook made reference to the ‘long line of authorities,’ it is clearer that the
principle in Sudbrook did buck prior precedent and was arbitrary as a result.
However, while the rule arose arbitrarily, perhaps it was done for good reason, Lazarides
saying in reference to Sudbrook, “that a rough and ready agreement to sell at a fair price
would be enforceable, but that a well drafted clause which specified an agreed method for
arriving at the contract price would not be.” This demonstrates that the rule in Milnes
served to undermine well drafted bargains, while the courts gave effect to less carefully
drafted bargains. Despite the fact that a more carefully drafted bargain demonstrates
objectively more intent to be bound. Equally it ignores the underlying intent that a ‘well
drafted clause,’ is first and foremost intended to find a fair and equal price for both parties.
As such the rule in Sudbrook worked to give effect to this intention, holding that the
specific machinery was non-essential and a fair price was the true intent. The court acted to
become the defender of bargains.

That being said, the argument made by Lazarides, regarding the inconsistencies between a
“well drafted clause [with] an agreed method for arriving at a contract price,” and a “rough
and ready agreement to sell at a fair price,” disregards the notion that a well drafted clause
with specific machinery in mind is the objective intention of the parties. Parties may draft a
clause carefully and freely with the intention that the machinery be essential. Freedom of
contract, and specifically term-freedom the notion that “the free area within which the
parties are permitted, in principle, to set their own terms should be maximised.
” In this
sense Sudbrook with its emphasis on the true intention set aside from the terms
undermines the ability of parties to ‘set their own terms.’ In Sudbrook the court effectively
created their own terms out of the apparent intention of the parties. This could easily be
seen as arbitrary as any ‘well drafted clause,’ could be set aside if the court sees it as being
seemingly contrary to the court breathed true intentions of the parties. If the true intention
of the parties was to arrive at a fair price and the machinery was just a term to make real
that intention, then the parties should have incorporated their intention as a term in the
contract. The term at issue in the contract does not include any reference to a fair and
reasonable price and such a term could only ever be implied and potentially arbitrary in the
sense of undermining the certainty of contract.

Yet such a black-letter interpretation of term-freedom would expose the parties to
considerable risk and ignore the reliance placed on agreements between the parties. The
extensive drafting of the clause created clear intention according to Lord Diplock “they
must have intended to create legal rights to have those provisions acted on by both parties
and not flouted by either party at his own sweet will.

” As such the extensive drafting
created a clear intention at the time for the parties to be bound. This was contradicted later
by the refusal to appoint a valuer but the intention at the moment of offer and acceptance is
what matters. As such the court was giving effect to the intention at the parties at the time
of contract, and reading the intention from the term. The machinery had one intention and
the inclusion of a minimum price demonstrated this intent further still, even if no term was
incorporated about a fair price. In that sense the term could be seen as not being arbitrary.
Overall, while arising arbitrarily the distinction between essential and non-essential
machinery exists for good reason. It enables the courts to act to protect bargains as well as
giving effect to the objective intention of the parties at the time of entering into a contract.
The next element of arbitrariness to be dealt with concerns inconsistent application. The
decisions in Sudbrook and Gillatt need to be reconciled. Failure to do so would
demonstrate inconsistent application and therefore arbitrariness. Gillatt determined that a
chartered accountant was essential to the contract. In Sudbrook it concerned a valuer. This
may seem arbitrary but it is an important distinction. In Sudbrook this eventuality is
mentioned directly with Lord Diplock saying in Sudbrook “[where a] price [is] fixed by a
named individual applying such subjective standards as he personally thinks fit, and that
individual, […] refuses to fix the price or is unable through death or disability to do so, the
contract of sale is thereupon determined by frustration.” While the term at issue in Gillatt,
Clause 6.1, does not give a name it does give a clear occupation “an independent chartered
accountant.” Independent chartered accountants do not necessarily arrive at a fair price but
use their own specific expertise to arrive at a valuation. Therefore, the objective intention is
not to use the accountant as the machinery to arrive at a fair price but to use the
accountant’s skills to find what the price ought to be. This may appear to be a very slight
distinction but it can be distinguished and it gives effect to term-freedom within contract.
The differing methods used by different accountants render the term closer to a May and
Butcher v. R, ‘price to be determined from time to time,’ as well. As such the lack of a
certain fair price to find independently of the machinery makes Gillatt different from
Sudbrook and a crucial refinement of the rule in Sudbrook.

That being said it could be argued that it is an arbitrary distinction without a place in
contract law. Could it not be argued that the clause in Gillatt was even more “well drafted,”
and Sudbrook was more of a “rough and ready agreement,” and as such the courts were
essentially reverting the rule in Sudbrook to prioritize upholding vaguer agreements while
letting well drafted ones fail. This may seem the case on first assessment but through the
clearer drafting the term becomes essential through application of the doctrine of term-
freedom. By clarifying their wishes even more clearly yet not incorporate a term specifying
their intent to find a fair price they demonstrated they intended to be bound by that
essential term rather than using the term as merely a mechanism to give effect to their
intentions. As such Gillatt does not represent an inconsistency with Sudbrook and it refines
the rule to give effect to wider principles in English contract law. Though again we must
justify term-freedom on its own merits. After all, would it not be arbitrary to hew to
principle and not question the validity of said principle. With regards to contract law,
“Frequently one party has little effective choice in the matter at all, and neither reads nor
understands, nor in any real sense agrees to the terms contained in such standard
documents.

” As such this lack of choice could undermine term-freedom. However with
both Sudbrook and Gillatt this is not operant as all parties are commercial enterprises and
thus they are endowed with ‘effective,’ choice.
Ultimately, while the rule in Sudbrook does overturn a long line of prior authorities and in
doing so arise arbitrarily, it does so for good reason, to give effect to the intention of the
parties when contracting, and it is not applied inconsistently and arbitrarily, with Gillatt
giving clearer rules and clarifying Sudbrook. On this application it is clear that the distinction
is not rather arbitrary, but grounded in clear principles of English contract law, and applied
clearly.
