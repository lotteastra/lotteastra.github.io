Sullivan v. Sullivan -> Case where a father created a trust accidentally, when his intention was to create a letter of intention as part of a will dispute with the children of a priror divorced spouse. Found that there was an equitable mistake on the basis of the trust that existed previously on account of the hardship, affirming Kennedy v. Kennedy and, Pitt v. Holt. The trust therefore ceased to take effect. Concerned with mistakes in equity

Arshad Mahmood v The Commissioners for His Majesty's Revenue and Customs -> Case at lower tribunal so likely not binding, where P pleaded common mistake on the basis of not knowing the tax liabilities incurred by a transfer of property. Tax law case. The plea of mistake fails as it can only apply as part of partial or prior to performance, and at any rate it would not be operative in this case as a result of the tax liability not being sufficient, and in any case had the mistake been operative the effect would not have been to make it as though the transfer had never happened, but rather to entitle return of money for the period the properties had been transferred.
